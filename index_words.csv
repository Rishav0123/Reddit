4,NOT EVERY STOCK IS A SHORT SQUEEZE,"Honestly lately every post I see is a “*RandomTicker* short squeeze buy now” You apes need to understand that having a 30% short interest doesn’t mean the stock is going to squeeze. Short squeezes are very unlikely and GME was/still is once in a decade oppurtunity. 

I currently hold 350 shares of BB at 14$ and I see apes throwing around short squeeze on BB. Like come on don’t be so retarded. BB isn’t a short squeeze play. It was an undervalued OG play of WSB from November. That’s why it’s been running up lately because market is finally realising it value. Not because there is a short squeeze happening. 

Anyways I know it isn’t a WSB post without rockets so BB GME AMC to the moooooooon 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀",4

9,$BB - Blackberry to participate in upcoming Investor Conference 9 Jun 2021,"Blackberry will be discussing the latest developments in BlackBerry’s technology and strategy, which is something I sure a lot of investors and a lot of us will be interested in listening to.

Link: [https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-to-participate-in-upcoming-baird-investor-conference](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-to-participate-in-upcoming-baird-investor-conference)

BB holds up on its own. I suspect the volatility we see is from the reasonably cheaper price it commands compared to favorites GME and AMC, where people from all walks of life are trying to sell off at every peak that occurs. Who knows, by Wednesday this shit shoots to $20 or more.

And now my honest opinion - fuck all the moon shit, because frankly all I see happening is people left at the peaks holding bags. You want to do something with BB, just like GME and AMC? Buy and hold, and let the market catch up to the potential that BB will become.

I'm sure a lot of you heard that GME and AMC might be added to RUSSELL 1000 based on performance by June 25 - well BB's earning report will be out at around the same time, June 23. So we shall see by then if BB stands strong, and not just because it is a meme.

This is not financial advice, good luck, and fuck the hedge fund fucks.",9

11,$BB🍇🍇🍇🍇,"Let's dig into the new BlackBerry IVY and it's possibilities and the system in general. But first let's touch base on the fact that BlackBerry and Amazon are no stranger to partnerships between the each other. In fact BlackBerry collaborated with Amazon all the way back in 2015 when Amazon integrated it's App store into BB10 devices which were run on QNX.🚀

So what is BlackBerry IVY? It is a multi-year agreement with Amazon Web Services(AWS). We can look at it as cloud platform for automotive industry to have vehicles exchanging information with one another as well as the passenger, automotive manufacturers, operators and even the grid of a smart connected city. 🚀

Let's start with the advantages of being connected to the manufacturer. We have already seen this in other EV's and unsecured technologically advanced vehicle platforms. This ability can help the manufacturer identify problems over the air and rectify them with secure updates or even issuing a message to the driver about the need to have something brought in to be looked at. For example a vehicle recall, battery replacement/upgrade, tire monitoring systems and more. 🚀

Now being connected to the passenger allows the system to deliver unique interactive cockpit experiences designed by the automotive brand and developers all while your vehicle drives you to work or even taxis others around while you're at work. It does this using vehicle data sensors and analytics to customize the users experience. 🚀

Enabling fleet operators with BlackBerry IVY unlocks the potential for massive improvements in logistics and asset tracking, BlackBerry already sells asset tracking devices for fleet operators (BlackBerry Radar) and is currently collecting and improving efficiencies for any operators utilizing it's system with data analytics and sensors.🚀

If the system is connected to the grid, this unlocks a massive opportunity to increase city and traffic efficiencies. Ever get stuck at a red light with no traffic coming in any direction? Now imagine lights turning green for a single vehicle or monitoring traffic and allowing heavier traffic to be given precedence at a intersection.🚀

V2V (vehicle to vehicle) communication will allow cars ahead of you to mark pot holes or warn other vehicles of the dangers ahead. Not only this but in autonomy V2V communication can allow possibilities like convoying with vehicles and drafting off each other bumper to bumper on a congested highway. What if the car in front of you stops? Each vehicle will know what will be happening with the vehicle in front of you, it will know anytime the other vehicles change speeds or engages the brakes. This could allow vehicles to travel safely and more fluently.🚀

TL;DR Basically IVY will improve efficiencies in a smart city, for operators, manufacturers and also increase personal productivity. It will do this by allowing you to get things done in your car and spending less time on the road and in traffic. It will enable this while maintaining the freedom and ability to operate the vehicle yourself. If you work 9-5 or have a road trip you can sit back be entertained, relax and eventually even sleep while your vehicle takes you places. They already have a patent for autonomous refueling which highlights the ability to be able to go anywhere and not get distracted by your travels. 🚀

16,CLOV - Short Squeeze is probably about to start,"What’s going on y’all. We got crazy action with GME, AMC, BB, short squeezing, and a bunch of stocks being added to the Russell. Few examples, (MindMed, PLTR, and many other “meme” stocks).

But guess what? Guess who else is being added to the Russell? You best believe it, CLOV is also being added to the Russell index.

As of time of writing, CLOV has gone up 20%.

Also as of time of writing, Ortex is reporting an estimated 39.36% SI (Short interest).

I believe that CLOV is about to match the uptick with the likes of AMC and GME.

Keep your eyes out on this stock.

Edit: Original post was removed I think because I put the DD flair instead of the discussion flair.

Edit: Can you guys upvote my comment where I tagged zjz and unpopular mods in the comment section to see why they took this post down? Thanks 🙏

Edit: The beauty mods of WSB have resurrected this post, thank you!

Final Edit: I just want to confirm when I said the “short squeezing” in my first paragraph, I meant stocks that fall under the “Squeeze Potential” category, whether it be a Short Squeeze or a Gamma Squeeze.

24,$CLOV= BET TORWARDS A BETTER AMERICA AND A BETTER SYSTEM,For years the health care industry has been ruining middle age and older Americans. For example they charge insane premiums that should be criminal. CLOV is a tech based company that truly gets Americans the cheapest Medicare that they can possibly receive. And for some odd reason these large institutions don’t see this company as solid. CLOV has been beaten to the ground and these institutions who are shorting this company don’t want them to succeed. They are trying to revolutionize the way we look upon healthcare. We have a 40% short interest and this isn’t even including the possible naked shorts that made AMC A TRUE PHENOMENON. They are growing at an insane rate and these large corporate suits do not enjoy them coming for there breadwinning healthcare center while simultaneously crushing poor to middle income Americans. I take it as this-if you purchase CLOV your taking a bet on america and the prosperous outcomes for a better healthcare system/provider. Shorting CLOV is unamerican and the suits that are doing such should be penalized by transferring there wealth into our pockets! Sorry if I sound like a retard but this is something that should be talked about!,24

31,What naked short selling is and why it’s illegal!,"Since about the mid-90s. Hedge funds were taking huge short positions to speculate (force the price down) on certain securities in the market. The prime brokers and market makers (scums in this aspect and the ones who execute trades for these firms $$) were not good with borrowing the large amount of shares shorted. This resulted in large amount of fails to deliver by settlement which is called a naked short sale. That is why in 2004, the SEC approved Regulation SHO, to eliminate the manipulative practice of naked short selling. To start, Rule 200 of Regulation SHO (Rules for short selling) defines a short sale as 1. The sale of a security that the seller does not own. Basically they are selling something they don’t own with a promise to give it back. 

The current issue with these firms is that they are most likely breaking rule 203 of reg SHO that requires short sellers in all equity securities to locate these shares before they can be borrowed. This also has to be in writing prior to effecting the short sale. This rule states that the firm cannot execute a short sale for an account unless the security has been borrowed or an arrangement has been entered into to borrow the security; or there are reasonable grounds to believe that the security could be borrowed and delivered on settlement. The firms are obviously breaking this rule when the float of GME was 140%, meaning there are not enough shares to cover the current short selling on the stock. The SEC had these firms meet a test to determine the securities that are easy to borrow (can easily be borrowed and returned with low risk) and hard to borrow called threshold securities (hard to get and have high risk of not being able to deliver). This list is updated daily by the firm and the test can be met by getting a clients assurance they can deliver on settlement which must be documented. (Let’s see Melvins..) 

The rule used to be that if a customer failed to deliver, if they had not delivered after 13 consecutive settlement days following the trade a mandatory buy in occurred which the firm loses money on. In 2009, the SEC passed rule 204 after the financial crisis to make  naked short selling illegal and mentioning it being one of the key reasons for the 08’ crash. This stated failed to deliver on any short sale has to be bought in no later then the day after settlement (T+3) resulting in losses for the firm. These rules are great if the SEC actually enforced them and held people/firms responsible. 

Since they are not, I am proud of this sub for creating the necessary spotlight on the scummy things Wall Street is still doing without any meaningful penalties by the SEC/FINRA. Main Street is actually making a impact to the future of trading in the best way possible, creating an equal field to battle big money. Who has the dumb money now Melvin? 

Thank you if you read this far and hopefully it helped you a bit.

(Edit)
TL;DR:
Naked short selling has been illegal since 2009, but is still occurring to this day and the SEC has not done anything to curb this behavior. WSB has put the spotlight on this and I am proud of the sub for that.

33,Bears beware SPCE is gone.,"I see a lot of postings from some talking about Virgin Galactic and flight performance, test flights and the technology being old. There were many X aircraft, specifically the Boeing X-20 Dyno. Wich resembles Virgin Galactic's plane most. 

The facts are this. In the dawn of the jet era many people sacrifice themselves to test jet aircraft as well as x aircraft. Till this day planes still have many incidences and sometimes crash, still millions of people travel on them. When the United States decided to go to the Moon with the Apollo space program there was test flight after test flight. There were many incidents and accidents yet NASA still went to the moon. 

Virgin Galactic is not going to fail, there's always going to be bumps in the road with testing new technology. 

Although the X aircraft program is ""old"" technology, the NEW technology that Virgin Galactic implemented with it's hypersonic plane is a ""feathering system based on Rutan's designs. The  entire tail structure can rotate upward, giving the craft the ability to slow down and float like a feather as it re-enters the upper atmosphere."" This is a new braking type system that lets the plane come back down through the atmosphere like a badminton birdie. 

These test flights take time and need to be done to insure this new technology is working properly. Virgin Galactic is also getting support from NASA for experiments and training astronauts. I don't see the company failing. In my opinion the company will continue to perform well.",33

40,"Apes 🦍 who missed on $GME! Listen up, $CLOV 🚀 is ready to lift off! We are going to the 🌖! Hop on before it's too late. High Short Interest + Low Float! 🚨","I will first give you some background about myself, have been lurking in this sub for quite a while now and absolutely love the community and fellow degenerate apes who steal tendies from the suits. I was lucky to get in on the $GME trade early on when it was still around \~$30, made some nice dough, and still hold a few shares. It was a no-brainer trade once it became clear that hedge funds fucked up by shorting too much and waited too long to cover their shorts.

I know many people missed that trade or lost because of bad entry/exit. But not to worry because guess what! A similar setup is building in $CLOV a.k.a Clover Health. A company brought to market by none other than the SPAC MAN himself `Chamath Palihapitiya`. Currently, it has a **short interest of \~44%** on a low float of \~110 million, with institutions owning a huge chunk. Also no risk of dilution. Just so you know what caused high short interest and to be transparent, Chamath somewhat fucked up on this deal as an existing lawsuit against Clover Health was hidden from investors during the SPAC merger, the reasoning was that it was immaterial. This was revealed by a research firm called Hindenburg Research, which in my opinion produces hit pieces for WallSt. hedge funds. So naturally, shorts piled in and dragged the stock lower.

Now coming to what's happening currently, first of all, the stock is up 55.61% in the past 5 days. You might think it is already rocketed, but do not make the mistake of thinking that it's late to get in. I entered $GME when it was \~$30, after stalking it from $4 and now the stock is $285. I know $CLOV is no $GME but the real value of the stock is being suppressed by greedy short sellers. There are multiple bullish catalysts: fundamental, technical, as well as market-based, all converging at once. Below is a brief list of them.

&#x200B;

1. Fundamental- $CLOV's latest financial results were Ok while the street was expecting them to be bad. The company has $720 million in cash!!! The lawsuit, mentioned earlier which was the main catalyst for short sellers to pile seems to be going nowhere, probably something to do with powerful and well-connected board members. Chelsea Clinton is one of them.
2. Technical- $CLOV price action today just crossed up its 200-day moving average with big green dildo up shorts asses. This is extremely bullish for the stock. And the price is supported by volume, as relative volume has exploded to 112 million, 5x of average, which means more people are piling in.
3. Market-based- $CLOV is going to be included in Ruseel 2000 index which means passive index fund buyers will be buying CLOV shares. This has brought in a lot of traders/speculators/investor interest, think about this like you being already aware that there will big line outside the Apple store once Apple announces a new device sale and you front run everybody to get in there before everybody else.

Also options volume today was huge, probably set up for a gamma squeeze effect. I suspect a lot of folks are trying to front-run what is inevitable, and that is $CLOV is going to the moon! I don't have a price target, because, given the trade setup and environment we are in, anything I will estimate might end up being low. If you cannot handle the volatility buy shares and sit tight, for more retarded apes options are the way to go. You are going to profit anyways.

[My position is total $10,000 in options.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/numqb5/clov_10k_position_lets_see_how_high_this_goes/?sort=top)

42,$CLOV - Unbiased Technical Analysis - Clean Breakout Today,"***TL;DR -*** Broke a key level today @ **11.86**

As long as we remain above resistances/target are **13.14, 13.71, 14.41, 15.45, 17.50** \- the first one being the most important - but be careful of all of them

Below, support is **10.83, 9.86, 9.14**

\-----

Seeing this one discussed more and more - and it's actually one of my favorites to trade - so I figured I'd drop a roadmap.

[$CLOV 1Y 1D](https://preview.redd.it/8bmwfuniqw371.png?width=2225&format=png&auto=webp&s=99f61cc11734a7821f5b1feeed9015ffa75fd6d6)

Not the prettiest pattern - but it's damn near all we have to work with here. Yeah you could draw a trendline from 1/27 - 4/29, but it doesn't do you any good in this situation. 

Perfect confluence with that **11.86 level -** this is the main one I've been keeping my eye on. The daily close above today was really important. This makes it a great level to play off of and manage risk with (you can put your stop loss somewhere under depending on your risk tolerance/sizing).

Below that main support level is **10.83, 9.86, 9.14.**

Basically - as long as we are above - we are in breakout mode targeting **13.14** mainly. With momentum - beyond that is **13.71, 14.41, 15.45, 17.50 -** but that first target is my **conservative** estimate. There **should** be some resistance there.

Also note really nice volume today - which is always a plus.

Yeah we might be overextended by traditional metrics - but I don't really look at those sorts of things - and in memes especially they are pretty useless. Just keep in mind any play on a stock this volatile is going to come with **increased risk** \- but I know you folks don't mind.

Small caps broke out big today and it's looking better and better for a lot of these names. Pretty awesome we managed to hold into a third week of this madness.

47,Blackberry Technical Analysis-Monthly Chart,"Hello,

Thought I'd post my thoughts on BB monthly chart. I posted short term predictions several days ago which have so far been accurate. follow link for those: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nt4o6b/blackberry\_technical\_analysis/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nt4o6b/blackberry_technical_analysis/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

**Set up:**

Initial squeeze looked like it would occur in January although same was subdued d/t Robinhood buy restrictions that began on January 28th. January monthly candle ripped to roughly 28 dollars USD. Consolidating monthly candles from February to May.

T**houghts on chart:**

BB hasn't been above 30 dollars since 2012. Resistance levels beyond 30 USD are extremely old. Rule of thumb is resistance levels become less significant as they age. Perhaps more difficult for shorts to find appropriate spots to step in. See image below. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Significant compression on January candle and June candles. See long wicks on top of candles where bullish break outs where rejected. These candles are similar to how a spring would build potential energy when being pressed down. The harder the downward force the greater the recoil will be. BB monthly chart is SPRING LOADED.. see image for same.

Looks like a monthly cup & handle formation that's taking place (image above). Note the volume expansion in January when SP exploded followed by SP consolidation and volume contraction. As stated in my previous post, volatility contracts ( February through to May) prior to expansion (hopefully June:)). 

&#x200B;

Share Price Target: Considering chart dynamics (e.g. degree of candle compression in January, cup and handle pattern poised for a monthly breakout), lack of reliable resistance levels, and what is currently occurring in similar WSB meme stocks.. I don't see a reason we can't **EASILY** hit +**100 USD** once short covering takes place.

60,Where can BB make it too besides the moon?,"I've been reading the BB tape for months. There is usually a very aggressive daily short position that takes about 20,000-40,000 shares after the open and keeps the price down. It generally stair steps the price down all day. It disappeared on the tape the moment it broke over 10 bucks. My guess is the big guys are ready to let the price start to sore. I doubt the real shorts went anywhere except for shorting at the top of key resistance levels.

If BB Ape buyers keep up the buying then BB could be sitting between extremely high historic levels at 42.49, 68.33, 85.32, AND 124.24 in a manner of weeks/months. Unlike AMC or GME, BB has historic levels to work off. That gives days traders and institutions a guide to trade and they will absolutely make those willing to take the risk a killing as this keeps going to their upper ranges. It will eventually be trading like the Internet of Things/Cyber Security that it is becoming before it monetizes and current buyers will just get in the ground floor and make some decent cash for their investment. When BB comes out showing that it has began to monetize the real accumulation phase will be over because the price will already be trading at the new ranges. Think TSLA, CCIV, etc. They all traded over their values highly and then fell back to earth before going back up. They whipsaw so that the big players can make money off selling high and buying low. Translate screw retail traders that buy high and then think its all over and sell low only to watch it rip again. 

My guess is that the sweet high spot of 85.32 is where BB will head to before a fall  for back to that 68.33 level. It will then  trade in range up towards 85.32 for a while. It will trade in a range for several months or up to a year or so before a rip beyond 85 to around the all time highs mentioned above as this becomes the new accumulation phase. The Prem Watsa's (Warren Buffett of Canada) will get BB to somewhere between the 70 and 80s before stepping off the gas and letting the shares fall back to no lower than the 20s-30s so they can acquire them again at a discount. Their motto is buy wholesale and sale retail. That is exactly what they did after the January surge. They bought every share they could at a discount and of course they sold some in the 10-20 range and will just buy more.

67,"Why $CLNE is still fine, despite the offering","So, I get it, offering be spooky. Management dumb. However, consider the following few points:

1. The offering is to sell 100m worth of shares over the next 3 years. Doesn’t mean they’re going to get dumped on the market tomorrow or even this year. If I were a betting man (which fucking duh I am), I would say that they’ve seen the interest lately and want to make sure they can sell when the stock reaches the fair value.

2. THIS POINT IS NOW WRONG. It is 100 million dollars worth of shares which is way less concerning to me. 

3. CLNE is still undervalued and MASSIVELY so. Fair value of CLNE in its current state is $24 a share. That’s without gamma squeeze stuff, without momentum stuff, just pure intrinsic value of the company.

4. It seems like the offering shot the stock price after hours, but look at the actual math. 760,000 shares traded after hours versus 27 MILLION daily volume. You could move the AH price with a small child’s piggy bank. After hours price isn’t really indicative of a ton. 

So at the end of the day, is it fucking annoying they announced it now? Yes, dumb marketing move, but it’ll be fucking fine, and it’s not that big a deal. Don’t panic and lose your head over nothing. 

TLDR: CLNE has the cow fart gas to go straight up and I expect it to🚀🚀🚀

MAJOR FUCKIN EDIT: I have lost my ability to read financial reports and it is actually 100 million dollars worth of shares, which is like 20x less concerning than 100m shares CARRY ON",67
68,To the guy who recommended Wendy's stock($WEN). (Proper DD),"Stick with me here.

[This, This right here.](https://preview.redd.it/vpfxsmf2lu371.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=a510b9f00a2ce223f5cee290e7abf0a2c30765c2)

Of course now im in, it makes perfect sense. **Literally its the perfect stock for this sub, let me explain.**

&#x200B;

**First**, they just came out with their new summer salad. Experts are already stating that this salad is the salad of the summer. See attached citation for review.  ([https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wendys-brings-back-seasonal-summer-strawberry-chicken-salad-301306465.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wendys-brings-back-seasonal-summer-strawberry-chicken-salad-301306465.html))

&#x200B;

**Second,** Wendys social media profile is no stranger to memes. Everyone has seen the ""Roast Me"" thing that Wendys has been doing. Well this will only increase with fellow autists supporting it. Academics have called this term ""metapragmatic roasting"" and its incredibly effective with the younger generation. Here is a chart demonstrating the breakdown of their tweets.

&#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0378216620301120#fig3](https://preview.redd.it/loppdub5mu371.png?width=357&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8c5b8485a2ab060d6c7f2a8585230fbd11dd707)

Here is another article from business daily demonstrating the effectiveness of Wendys perceived social media presence. [https://journal.businesstoday.org/bt-online/2018/wendys-twitter-presence-the-art-of-creating-beef-over-beef](https://journal.businesstoday.org/bt-online/2018/wendys-twitter-presence-the-art-of-creating-beef-over-beef)

&#x200B;

**Third**, Both Gamestop and Wendys have been sharing in this Social Media ""Beef"" or ""Metapragmatic Roasting"" of each other. Their Twitter profiles are actively following each other and going off each others posts. See the below image for an example. ([https://twitter.com/gamestop/status/1224739308013309952?lang=en](https://twitter.com/gamestop/status/1224739308013309952?lang=en))

&#x200B;

[Coincidence? ](https://preview.redd.it/zug6vms5nu371.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=2144efe81af5d11abfd7702386aa5301defef822)

**Forth, well this one is obvious but Wendys Chicken Tendies. Literally the perfect stock for this sub.**

&#x200B;

So lets talk technical. Supposedly $WEN (Wendy's) has a low public float of around 17 million shares. It has between a 4-10% short which will increase as the stock increases because fast food retail is a relatively predictable stock (Same reason why Utility Companies will get shorted to shit when they rise look at $NEE earlier this year).

&#x200B;

With an average volume of around 1 Million per day there is a huge amount of Alpha to be had in investing in Wendys. Right now the Implied Volatility on options is tiny (29-34%) which means that you can get a position for pennies on the dollar. Further, buying shares is small as well as its currently not a volatile company. Either way its a good investment because of the Salad.

&#x200B;

Im in at $22.97 and calls expiring on January of next year.

&#x200B;

This is not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor. I just really like the stock, and Wendys.",68

77,RKT's new friend and the Russell Shuffle 1000,"This could be pretty huge for the stock. 

Russell 1000 index officially began to add RKT. This is good for WSB because mid-cap stocks are higher risk, higher reward. This may be why RKT has been trading different than meme stocks, but also somewhat impacted still since it's included largely in the social sentiment etf. RKT has had a recent increase in volume over the past 2 weeks and I think it's because investors are adding in preparation of Russell 1000 additions . This link will provide pretty much everything you need to know about the Russell Shuffle (I know it's Barron's but it's not a persuasive article, just sited info.)

""For investors, the run-up to the rebalancing presents an opportunity to get ahead of some of the fund flows into and out of stocks that are joining or leaving the indexes.

Russell will release its preliminary indexes on June 5. They are based on May 8 prices, which allows analysts and investors to approximate the lists ahead of time. The actual rebalancing will take place after the market closes on Friday, June 26. Tens of billions of dollars of shares will be traded in the closing minutes to align with the new indexes.

Bank of America Securities anticipates that more than 200 stocks will move in and out of Russell’s indexes, with more shifting between their growth and value subindexes""

[https://www.barrons.com/articles/how-investors-can-play-the-rebalancing-of-the-russell-indexes-51590158778](https://www.barrons.com/articles/how-investors-can-play-the-rebalancing-of-the-russell-indexes-51590158778)

&#x200B;

**Prior to May RKT was primarily held in growth funds.**

There are two types of Russell 1000 investments: growth and value.

Value - **An investment strategy that involves picking stocks that appear to be trading for less than their intrinsic or book value.**

**Growth - An investment strategy with less emphasis on valuation! Hence the undervaluation and more on growth.**

[https://www.investdavenport.com/the-value-vs-growth-debate/](https://www.investdavenport.com/the-value-vs-growth-debate/)

&#x200B;

What's interesting is that growth funds have sold RKT and value funds are picking it up so we can assume Russell has it within their value index as well.  I THINK THIS IS HUGE....maybe a better P/E or just more volume.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TLDR: This means we can expect different price action with RKT, possibly less suppression, and possibly enhanced PE ratios.  This also means volume, primarily in the month of June. When you combine volume, a small float, and WSB with an undervalued historically manipulated company - you get moon. Don't be fooled...RKT can sky rocket and can be a dominant company that leads Russel to new highs. Rank 194 out of 500 in fortune 500 - cant be in sp 500 because of dual class shares, but I believe Russ is better for the stock anyway. The chart is also super bullish right now and this is great for the future of the stock.  Such a weird stock man....we are invested by the David Portnoy fund and the Russ 1000 at the same time. I think it's mooning though.

&#x200B;

Not financial advice just sourcing.

Edit: This will have a bigger impact as well when RKT continues to transfer class D shares to class A increasing the float as they have already done this once.",77

This combined with a 38% borrowing fee for new shorts gives great opportunity for the stock to gain some much needed traction. As of now we can see several EFTs (Vangard) purchasing shares to qualify for the dividend and can expect other large firms to do so in the next couple of days. Other catalysts include a buyback of 300M announced by UWMC and a potential Russell 3000 inclusion (if anyone can figure out what inclusion/exclusion qualifiers to follow). All that said, it’s plain and simple. This stock needs some volume to really take off and we should get a preview in the next few day. Note: All data/numbers are from Fintel.

82,EMERGENCY DD,"Fellow retards,

I need you all to focus for just a few minutes please. I've been a member of this sub long before any of you bought your first FD. I'm not against new tards or trying to gatekeep anyone. But anyone in this cesspool, especially the newer members, need to know what they're up against.

Day after day the front page and daily are being spammed with shill accounts or bots and people are blindly following it. Or maybe the mods are asleep at the wheel or bots can move posts faster than genuine posts. Idc what your positions are, what you stand for, just get those bags.

These are just some of the tickers I see being shoved down your throat all over this sub from people/accounts that are suspicious to say the least. As many of you may know, Citadel who has major undisclosed and still open short positions against GME and AMC is long on these companies that are being spewed here in WSB. So if you have any interest in either of these heavily manipulated stocks and maybe don't want to to the bidding of these abusive short hedge funds, consider what they are trying to manipulate in this sub.

Also, please note, these are just the disclosed positions. Short positions are not disclosed on 13F's and they do not directly equate to those short positions. Married options do exist and they are often used to ""adjust"" a hedge funds overall position/leverage so they don't get a call from marge; but this still gives us some insight even if its not the whole picture.

84,CLNE and their DIRTY SEC filings today ewwww... (Mr. CLNE not so dirty after all),"^(Disclaimer: this post has nothing to do with any squeeze and will not include any rocket emojis - I'm sorry if that offends you)

TL;DR: If you believe in the thesis of the company, nice long term growth in an emerging market, this is not even a speed bump on the path to success. This, though not optimal, is how they choose to fund infrastructure projects.

^(None of this is financial advice, and you should review these filings yourself and develop your own opinions.)

# So, ya boy, CLNE, filed a form 8K with the SEC today. ""They're diluting the stock and all of our livelihoods are about to go down the drain."" Not quite...

I'm sorry it took me an hour to get to typing this - reading 8k's takes way too much time. If you've been following CLNE since before this traffic picked up, then you're already well aware of what you're about to read. However, since a lot of you are new to this company I'll write out why they do this, what their goals are, and what it means for the stonk.

Todays filing is something that CLNE has done in the past. We can use the most recent A.T.M. (at the money, not ass to mouth sorry) offering as an example:

* May 10th - CLNE announces A.T.M. offering, capped at $100 million, purpose to fund infrastructure projects
* Between now and then - shares are sold, money is made, funding infrastructure projects
* June 7th (today) - The offering is complete, $99,999,976 is generated, the offering is closed

In today's 8K filing, the closure of that offering above was reported. In the same 8K they opened up a new A.T.M. offering that is **(spoiler alert) going to look exactly like the one above**

* June 7th - CLNE announces A.T.M. offering, capped at $100 million, purpose to fund infrastructure projects
* Between now and when it closes - shares are sold, money is made, projects funded
* Closing day in the future - The offering is complete, about $100 million is generated, the offering is closed

Do you sense a pattern here? Maybe you do have a wrinkle after all... This method of operating, though I don't necessarily agree with it, is a stable and quick way to generate capital to fund a rapidly expanding infrastructure system. They're building stations (565 last time I checked). They're expanding their footprint and capabilities. They're building capture facilities to increase raw material for production. They're **laying pipe** (heyyyyy there).

The day will come when CLNE will fund 100% of their projects and expansion with revenue, and with their market emerging and being so well positioned, I don't think that day is far off. With partnerships from the likes of Total, Chevron, BP, Amazon, UPS, and others they clearly have sales and revenue downstream. The best way to reach them all is to expand, and (at least for right now, in the eyes of the company) the best way to expand is these small offerings.

I'll link the 8K in the comments.

Do your own DD, see you on the moon.

•	Current share price $31.80. 

•	TTM P/E = 20.59x. 

•	% Held by Institutions = \~77.24% but with insider shareholders hold 81.04% of the float.

Turtle Beach is trading at 11.29x and near ATH. Logitech trades at 24.03x and is at ATH. Now this is difficult for CRSR because they just IPO’d less than a year ago. P/E ratio will likely step more in line with next earnings. 

TL:DR $CRSR See no negatives whatsoever. Only thing that could possibly offer safer returns is ornamental gourds. Literally can’t go tits up. Not a financial advisor or analyst. I just like the stock. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

88,6/7 updated CLOV technicals from a dummy,"Wow what a crazy day. Happened fast. Some things to note on the Daily and 10min charts:

&#x200B;

* Nice volume on the day.

&#x200B;

* Decisively came out of the AVWAP pinch and is now well above AVWAP of the previous high.

&#x200B;

* $13.70 to $14.35 looks to be the next volume supply zone to take out.

&#x200B;

* If it breaks above $14.35 it could test all time high of $17.45. Usually I'd imagine this would be a longer timeline (weeks, months) but if there is any kind of short squeezing obviously things can happen fast like we saw today.

* On the 10min chart below it beautifully rode up the 5-12 EMA cloud with a little sideways action between $11.00 and $11.30 before it broke through.

&#x200B;

* Pretty great closing volume on the day and it seems to be running after hours.

89,$CLOV & $DNMR Flash Buy Signals,"One tried and true method of deciding when to buy—and when to sell—is to watch the charts. Clover Healthcare (CLOV) and Danimer Scientific (DNMR) both flashed buy signals in the past few days. Both companies are the target of Short Seller attacks and law firms soliciting customers to join shareholder lawsuits. The good news is that both CLOV and DNMR are rebounding, and I think this is just the beginning. Both are well off their 52 week highs, and both have a long way to run.

One of the simplest methods for new investors to answer the question of when to buy is to watch the Simple Moving Averages (SMA). When the 5 Day Moving Average crosses the 30 Day Moving Average going up, it’s a buy signal. 

Using this method, AMC gave a buy signal on May 13th, when the stock closed at $12.98. We all know what happened after that.

https://preview.redd.it/6p6b9786ow371.jpg?width=1049&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf9859bdf9aae55e8c9789b566e21e2231460f85

This method isn’t foolproof. It will give some false buy and sell signals, and by definition you won’t catch the high or the low, but it will catch major up and down trends.   


**$CLOV gave a buy signal on June 3rd, when the stock closed at $8.90**  
CLOV also gave a false buy and sell in May, essentially selling it and buying it back at the same price.

https://preview.redd.it/7y4x7t5cow371.jpg?width=1049&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7350ae99bd09b9121e359dd44801208114c36cbd

**$DNMR gave a buy signal on Jun 1st, when the stock closed at $21.88.**  
Following this signal with DNMR, you would have had a false sell and buy signal in Feb and Mar, but you would have sold it at $37.90 on 3/25, preventing a long, painful ride down before it bottomed out at $15.38. Selling it at $37.90 and buying it back at $21.88 would also let you buy back more shares. 

https://preview.redd.it/n75xpi6kow371.jpg?width=1049&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5bae3f68eb5c966cf9fe8a9526d7d1b4fc64409a

Even with the occasional head fakes, this signal catches the long term trends up and down. I think it’s another useful datapoint to double-check your investment decisions.  
 

**Support and Resistance**  
 As another datapoint, both CLOV and DNMR are above most of their moving averages. CLOV is above its 30, 50, 100 and 200 day moving averages. DNMR is above its 30, 50 and 200 day moving averages, but still below its 100 day moving average.  
 

**CLOV**  
 30 Day SMA: 8.30  
 50 Day SMA: 8.19  
 100 Day SMA: 9.61  
 200 Day SMA: 10.55  
 

**DNMR**  
 30 Day SMA: 21.61  
 50 Day SMA: 26.06  
 100 Day SMA: 34.60  
 200 Day SMA: 23.90  
 

**Fundamentals are Strong**  
Both $CLOV and $DNMR have fundamentally strong businesses in the early growth stage. Clover is a small, growing healthcare company with proprietary software. Danimer Scientific makes biodegradable plastic resin, and is aiming to address the single use plastic waste crisis. I believe both companies have bright futures, with sales and earnings expected to continue climbing in the years ahead.  
 

**Short Interest**  
This isn’t the reason to buy, but it may be icing on the cake. According to Marketwatch, CLOV has 35.8% of the float shorted, well above GME (21%), AMC (18.93%) and BB (9.0%). DNMR has 15.8% of its float shorted. (I realize this varies from day to day and site to site)

**CLOV: 35.8% of Float Shorted**  
**DNMR: 15.8% of Float Shorted**  
 

**Summary**  
 I believe CLOV and DNMR have bright, promising futures, and I expect them to gain both short term and long term.

101,TICKER FOMC Making Headlines,"
I’ve realized when I talk about this stock most people have no idea what it is. It would behoove investors to look into this company for what it does to help the environment. 

I’ll give you a quick rundown

FOMO Corp (ticker FOMC) buys companies, full or partial, that are designed for building a better world. For example, clean air businesses, smart tech, or anything that helps the environment while saving money. So far, after only 8 months, they have acquired the following companies.

Purge Virus (partnered with Safely Open Schools, government affiliated, worked on Navajo Nation)

They provide clean air filtration devices as well as fitting air ducts to best clean the air

Independence LED (Worked with NAVY, Walter Reed and veterans affairs)

+ 

Energy Intelligence Center (completes the energy savings synergies of the previous 2)

These two companies work similarly in that they are cost effective businesses, saving energy as well as money for businesses of all types. 


The following companies are under Definitive Agreement

To close 6/31
Smartguard Energy (LUX and LED) has a deal with the largest casino operator in the world for 20 million dollars as well as two deals being bid on for 100 mill plus
Smartguard Solutions (Disinfection, partnership with Cleanspark)

Companies under LOI include

Ecolite

The sales pipeline is immense but most would wonder, why are they at .0031 and most importantly, why did it fall from .027.

Well, a lot of people were interested in the meme aspect of the company, fomo. When FOMO wasn’t the ticker they left. And when they left, the shorts came in creating a current 70% short volume consistently. Additionally, the past few days we’ve seen up to 40 mill share walls put up to scare investors into selling. 

That’s why I’m trying to get the word out. We need to fight back through getting the word out on the ideas of clean and smart energy. This is a real company at the ground-level, with insane upside. FOMo Corp just got a new CEO in 2019 and were a zero bid stock. Now, the sales pipeline is worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Our market cap, assuming all deals get closed is under 55 million. And that doesn’t add up. 

We’re ready for a move up.",101

Furthermore, their short interest has been increasing over the past few weeks and the shorts haven't yet covered. What do you think of this? I really feel it has a great potential for short squeeze to values above $10+ !

107,Trading Frenzy? Who actually starts it?,"With all that is going on, I don't believe that the significant price fluctuations and stock volatility of AMC, GME, and all the other meme stocks are actually started by retail investors. I believe it is and has always been started by institutional investors with big money.

To cause the price of a stock to increase significantly in a short period of time requires a lot of money. It is odd to see the majority of meme stocks to coincidently go up significantly out of the blue at the same time on the same day/week when the stocks were trading sideways for months. I don't believe meme stock retail traders all got together on the same day and time and purchased a ton of stocks causing the price to go up significantly even though it might seem that way.

My theory is that the big banks know that most meme stock dedicated traders are all fired up for these stocks. They capitalize on this by purchasing significant amounts of meme stocks (AMC, GME, BB, etc.) all at the same time in hopes that they would start a frenzy for at least one of those meme stocks. When a frenzy does start, there are several narratives that retail investors and even news outlets then use to explain the frenzy. 1. short squeeze. 2 options activity, etc. etc. But, the case here is, who starts it? The better question is: who are the only investors able to start a frenzy? Big banks with a lot of money. They know who they're trading against, and their strategy is to utilize retail traders to their advantage by taking control of the perception of the market all the way through. Why would they want to start a frenzy? To sell off at the top with the help of retail investors. Because, right now, it seems that everyone thinks it's retail traders driving the price when that might not actually be the case at all.

The problem here is that there is a lack of transparency that the big banks take advantage of and it's important because now it seems the SEC is trying to lay regulations that would affect trading on the retail side. The issue here isn't with retail investors, but the lack of transparency of why and how a price of a stock increases significantly.

The solution? For starters, require brokerages to display data on big, large volume institutional purchases/sales (on what SEC considers meme-stocks) in real time to retail investors to prevent narratives that intend to blindly shift the blame of price fluctuations and stock volatility on retail investors. In my opinion, it's always the big banks that start the frenzy, and I believe the ""trading frenzy"" will keep happening until there is full transparency. It's happened numerous times already.",107

110,Cramer is wrong on CLNE,"Not investing advice. Just my personal thoughts. 

I just read somewhere that cramer was cynical about CLNE. Not sure if true but have no reason to doubt it. Apparently he does not think trucks will be using natgas and thinks EV is the only way to go. 

Newsflash Cramer: big trucking fleets and municipal fleets have already adopted natgas. In a big way. Specifically they are embracing RNG because it is the cleanest fuel out there with a negative carbon footprint. Nobody is going to use natgas? Why dont you tell that to UPS and AMZN. AMZN has agreed to buy up to $500mm in RNG and that is excluding certain transfer costs so the total revenue opportunity is closer to $800mm according to credit suisse. These big customers have already invested millions in RNG engines and they did not do so because they thought “hey wouldnt it be fun to run our trucks on cow farts.”

Bottom line: There are lots of naysayers out there who pretend like they know everything. Yes Cow farts are easy to dismiss. And CLNE is a relatively undercovered name. And yes Wall street analysts find it easy to spread misinformation on CLNE via controversial research in order to make a name for themselves. And yes RNG is a niche area today vs wind and solar. BUT the big fleets are bringing this fuel into the mainstream and that is the real story. Those that are poo pooing RNG are dismissing something they do not quite understand yet. You and i will never run our cars on RNG because the refuelling infrastructure does not exist. But the commercial fleets need a fuel that not only takes them from A to B but also allows them To hit their carbon reduction targets.

Aside from being a direct fuel source for trucks it seems that hydrogen production via electrolysis would be a natural place for RNG to be used. To be clear CLNE does not to the best of My knowledge sell RNG to the likes of BE or PLUG but if they continue to aggressively build out their methane capture capabilities why wouldn’t RNG become a carbon negative fuel stock for hydrogen? Welcome other’s thoughts who might know more. 

Whatever the short term fluctuations CLNE is a long term buy and hold. Stock has popped and there will be profit takers. But the real rewards will go to those that can see past the noise.",110
111,BB vs GME observation,"This may be an obvious observation, but looking at the 5 day charts of BB and GME, it looks like they are in total lock-step with each other. The BB spike last Thursday morning lags just a little behind the GME spike on Wednesday afternoon, and after that they line up perfectly.

Could an ape with a few more wrinkles than I chime in why they think these two mimic each other so much? Is it from us buying and selling both at the same times? Or gamma squeeze happening at the same times?

114,AMC technical analysis 6/7,"**DISCLAIMER:**  I am retarded and this is not financial advice, and my wife's boyfriend is not a financial advisor. **Credit** for TA at the bottom of the post

EDIT: AMC STOCK is at a record high because of us apes. As a business with no ape backing, it is not worth what it is now. I guess I made it seem like I would be holding post squeeze? That is not the case. I am going to ride the wave up and get out and die in the void of fucking space. Be sure to sell when the profits meet your expectation and do not gamble with money that you cannot afford to lose. 

**Derp:**

We are at a critical point for AMC; either we make it or don't. I have the utmost faith in the community and in all the shareholders that we are going to be able to hold and not succumb to the pressures of major financial entities. I, for one, will not be selling. I have waited 6 months and invested thousands of dollars into an idea and cause that I believe. It is a total success or complete failure for me. I am not saying that it needs to be that way for you, but we can only win this together. I have been reading a lot of varying opinions on the future of AMC stock. From a technical standpoint, we have reached the top. However, if we can develop a strong uptrend, we can win. I just wanna be that guy getting his knob slobbed in the handicap stall in a Wendy's bathroom for once in my miserable cuck life. 

**Technical Analysis:**

We are at a major determining point for AMC First, let's look at the Daily (left side): We hit an RSI of around 96 the second time and are highly oversold. The first time it markets a temporary Top! Normally a stock moves in Waves. We detached from the MAs and are likely to return to the 50 EMA earlier or later. Volume Analyses also show signs of excessive bullish volume we normally see on overshooting tops.

Let's look at a shorter time frame now (4h - right side): We see a weakening RSI. The Trend has not broken down so far, and the 9 ema is still holding. I suggest at least set a stop or Trailing stop below here. The VolumeAnalyses is showing sell signs (red triangle down) In case of a pullback, the first ""Volume support"" is around 15, marking the top of the prior re-accumulation phase. A backtest of the ""last point of support"" is normally needed to confirm the bias and regain strength for the next move. The bullish scenario would be a pullback on low volume that is holding the support zones.

However, Exploring Gann fans. AMC has been respecting the 1:2 and trading in that channel. If the Current low respects the 1:1 trend line, then there's room for a move from 45 to 216 in one day. Not that it will, but that's the ""reasonable"" limit. If it significantly breaks the 1:1, well, then the fun's over, I suppose.

Note: Gann Fan is built using the lows from the 24th and 27th; the connection to the close on Friday is a coincidence.

120,Forget Britney. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is the Only Conservatorship You Should Care About 🚨🚀🚨🚀🚨🚀🚨,"What follows got downvoted in the daily, and for the life of me, I can't understand why.  Either you can't read more than 3 words in a row without a rocket emoji, think the entire stock market exists on 3 tickers, or you hate money.

🚨🚨🚨

tl;dr:  Buy $FNMA shares and hold for the month.  There are no options on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, so stop asking for strikes and expiry.  Why?  The Supreme Court may issue an opinion this month that releases Fannie and Freddie from the FHFA's conservatorship.  Were this to happen, Fannie and Freddie would no longer need pay their entire profit margin to the government, and the Feds might actually have to pay back to the companies the entire excess above the bailout received:  $110 BILLION. 

🚀🚀🚀

In 2017, Fannie Mae (Fannie) and Freddie Mac (Freddie) shareholders sued then Sec. of Treasury Mnuchin, (now called Collins v. Yellen, after the administration change), that is now waiting on an opinion from the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS or the Court).

The Shareholders argue that Fannie and Freddie were unlawfully placed into a conservatorship by the Federal Housing Finance Authority (FHFA), because FHFA's creation violates the separation of powers.

The questions present to the Court SCOTUS are:

1.	⁠⁠Whether FHFA’s structure violates the separation of powers; and

2.	⁠⁠Whether courts must set aside a final agency action when the agency was unconstitutionally structured and strike down the statutory provisions that make FHFA independent.

""Ginger, what the fuck does that mean?""

Well, for all you non lawyers, those with a fifth grade education from the good ole US of A should know that separation of powers means the legislative, executive, and judicial branches must act independently of one another.  If they do not, and, for example, the executive branch creates a government agency to oversee the mortgage collateralization without a direct authorization from Congress, the agency is unconstitutional and all its actions are therefore invalid.

Such are the arguments made in the Petitioners' case:  if FHFA was structured unconstitutionally, therefore, all of FHFA's actions, including the action to place Fannie and Freddie into a conservatorship, were unconstitutional.

""Ginger, so what?  I still don't see rocket ship emojis, and Fannie Mae doesn't rhyme with Gamestop, AMC or Blackberry.""

Well, my smooth brained degenerate, as part of its actions, the FHFA created a Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement whereby Fannie and Freddie must pay, to the government their entire net worth on a quarterly basis, minus a small capital buffer.

""Ginger, I still don't get it.""

Wow.  You really are an orangutan.  Back when most of you were hiding your boners with a textbook when changing classes, a little thing called the Great Recession happened. At an extremely high level, that even an ape can understand:  Banks did bad things.  These bad things were bought by Fannie and Freddie.  The bad things Fannie and Freddie bought almost wiped them out if not for a government bailout.  As part of bailout, the government now receives a ""dividend"" equal to all of the Companies profit on a quarterly basis.  This is called the Net Worth Sweep.

""Ginger, is that a big deal?""

Duh.  Fannie has $3.5 Trillion in assets on its books.  The next closes company, is JP Morgan at 2 Trillion.  Fannie alone has 75% more assets than the next closest company.  If you're thinking ""Holy fuck"", you're right.

""Ginger, but wait does this mean the Court is going to give Fannie and Freddie back the money and stop holding its balance sheet hostage?""

I don't know, but I sure fucking hope so!  SCOTUS is grappling with a situation where FHFA is unconstitutional and what will happen with all the money the conservatorship collected over the last 12 years. (SCOTUS won't decide what to do with the money - it will decide the questions of federal and constitutional law, and kick the decision back to the Circuit and District Courts to issue the order consistent with its opinion.)

""Ginger, what kind of profit could we be looking at?""

Fannie is trading at $2.3 per share right now.  Fannie does $25 Billion in revenues a year.  At a conservative 4x multiple, Fannie is a $100B company.  At a 20x multiple, $500B.

""Ginger, why do I have to buy now?""

The Court releases opinions usually on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and on the third Monday of each sitting. The Court goes into summer recess at the end of the month and its next term doesn't start until Sept. - Oct. Collins was argued back in December, and its possible an opinion will be issued before the end of the current term.  If you wanna gamble, it won't cost you much.

Why it sounds absurd is because the current difference between the 6&7$ calls is 5.80-4.90=90c. For 5 contracts the max loss would be 500*90c = 500$. Since the calls premiums would always move in tandem I can understand how the risk could go beyond this and I have 2k in my account cash.",123

MOON TIME! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀","Industry groups from Japan and Finland will conduct joint research and development of sixth-generation communications technology, looking to lead the creation of 6G standards in a field increasingly influenced by Chinese companies.

Finnish telecom supplier Nokia, a global leader in the industry, will join the effort.

Japan's Beyond 5G Promotion Consortium will sign the agreement soon with Finnish group 6G Flagship. The accord is to be announced Tuesday at the Global Digital Summit 2021, an event organized by Nikkei and Japan's Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications.

The initiative follows a [$4.5 billion commitment](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Telecommunication/US-and-Japan-to-invest-4.5bn-in-next-gen-6G-race-with-China) by Japan and the U.S. toward the development of next-generation communications technology, in a partnership announced in April. Extending the cooperation to ""third-countries"" to promote secure connectivity is seen helping in the competition with China to set global standards.

The Beyond 5G Promotion Consortium, which aims to commercialize 6G technology in the 2030s, includes the University of Tokyo along with major Japanese telecom players such as Nippon Telegraph & Telephone, NTT Docomo, KDDI, SoftBank Corp. and Rakuten Mobile. 6G Flagship is led by Finland's University of Oulu.

Members of the Japanese consortium will engage in joint research projects and personnel exchange. The group is in talks for future collaboration with an American counterpart that includes telecom supplier Cisco Systems and chipmaker Intel.

Shares of 5G patents owned by Japanese developers have fallen behind the likes of South Korea's Samsung Electronics and U.S. player Qualcomm. NTT Docomo holds about 6% of 5G patents, compared with roughly 10% for Qualcomm and China's Huawei Technologies.

The internal affairs ministry aims for Japan to command at least a 10% share in 6G patents together with a slice of 30% or more in equipment and software.

128,How to REALLY Keep Your Broker from Loaning Shares to Shortsellers,"**The way to make sure your broker can't loan out your shares to a shortseller is to sign a ""Loan Exempt Restriction"" (if you have a margin account)**, or by switching your account to ""**CASH"" only (no margin).**   This does not affect your ability to sell your shares, but it does prevent your broker from loaning your shares to a shortseller. Cash accounts cannot be used to loan shares. 

I’m seeing a lot of people saying you should place a VERY high sell order (i.e Sell CLOV at $400). Unfortunately, that still doesn’t prevent your broker from loaning out the shares to a short seller. (If you have documentation to the contrary, please share it- I'd love to be wrong on this!). 

Every broker has permission to loan out your shares buried in their fine print. That means they can loan your own shares to a shortseller who is hoping to drive the price down. In a nutshell, you're inadvertantly helping someone hurt you. 

Place a **""Loan Exemp Restriction"" or ""Lock""** on your account now! As an alternative, you can ask your broker to turn off ""Margin"" trading or switch your account to **""Cash.""**

131,TELL: The company that reminds you of stocks you missed out on,"Where were you when Tesla was trading in double digits? Oftentimes as investors, we all have what-if scenarios and regrets about not capitalizing on an opportunity at its infancy.

As it goes, when a new industry is about to break out, there will always be two sides: those who believe and those who doubt. History either remembers you as a winner or a loser.

What if I told you the energy industry is about to make history now? That’s right, reminiscing of the early days of e-commerce and EVs, today LNG is what these industries were at their childhood stages.

# So what’s the deal with natural gas (LNG)?

According to forecasts, the current demand for LNG in 2021 is around 300mpta, and is looking to more than double to 700mpta by 2040. This is evident considering our world is in the process of a transition from coal and high emission energy production, LNG demand keeps increasing every year establishing itself the ultimate cost-efficient solution for a transition to cleaner energy.

>And while in an ideal way we’d prefer to skip LNG and go directly into clean renewables, reality doesn’t paint the same picture.

Simply put, there isn’t enough supply for the huge demand we require. Not only that, but for a lot of developing countries, the question isn’t even how do we clean our emissions? It’s for all intents and purposes how do we even produce enough energy?

This is where Tellurian Inc. (NASDAQ:TELL) plays its cards. Founded in 2016 by the godfather of LNG Charif Souki and his longtime associate Martin Houston, Tellurian aims to build a natural gas business of approximately 27.6mpta/year through their Louisiana Driftwood LNG terminal.

>This ambitious project would put it as the biggest LNG terminal of North America thus far.

# Let’s look at the company

Leadership wise, the company is led by the best men in the industry. The veteran board of directors not only is accredited to have delivered 18% of LNG today, but have a clear vision for a booming gas industry. With their integrated business model and favorable gas prices (According to JKM, TTF and Henry Hubs spot prices), the company has successfully signed two 3mtpa long-terms deals with two global players (Gunvor and Vitol) in the last two weeks, with no signs of stopping eithers on the road to complete the 11mtpa/year requirement to complete Phase 1 one of the project.

>The company boasts a strong balance sheet with no debt, and has successfully secured all the necessary building permits (By no means an easy thing with clean energy lobbies).

Therefore, and as predicted, the next step is starting construction at some point during this summer. In the upcoming weeks, we should see even more action, as the company is looking to close even more, perhaps bigger deals especially with Korea, whom they’ve been strengthening their relationship with for the past months.

>But despite it and like any stock, certain risk management has to be assessed.

For instance one of the earliest equity partners, Total S.A, has shed more than 23 million shares over the past months. The exact reason for this is unknown, but most analysts are wary. It’s also noteworthy that according to an agreement by the two parties, Total would have to buy 20 million shares at 12$ if Tellurian secures FID (Final Investment Decision) by June, a task they failed so far.

Coincidentally, should Tellurian not reach FID by the required date, Total is free to completely walk out of the arrangement without repercussions. Should this be a big concern? We know that the management has anticipated and as expected flexed the plan so that dependency on Total is no longer required at all in the long run. It’s also just as important to bring up the fact Total is going through a complete rebranding after their two failed LNG startups in Mozambique and Myanmar, both halted due to armed conflicts in the area and estimated to cost them billions of damage. So maybe this divorce won’t be so bad after all.

You may also find the use of an ATM (At The Market Offering) over the course of the year an important variable to reflect on before investing. According to the 2020 Q4 report, and 2021 Q1 report, the company has utilized ATM three times over the course of the year to raise upwards of 200mil$. And while you usually hate to see the shares diluted, you have to respect the end goal behind it, as the company looked to raise enough money to clear the balance sheet and stay debt free, as well as resuming drilling and acquiring more upstream reserves.

According to Souki himself, it was stated ATM would only be used if absolutely necessary and if it benefits the company as a whole. The manner and timing in which it was executed was very calculated as well and minimized any potential side effects we could’ve had from this dilution. In the future, the company has maintained its strong position of not needing any more ATMs to raise cash.

# Stock price action

So what’s the stock price like? Have I missed the hype? Well let’s just say there are three trains. The short term train left exactly two weeks ago, the mid term is waiting for passengers, and the long term one hasn’t arrived yet.

At the time of this article, the stock is trading at around 5$, consistently breaking peak after peak for the year, after having traded as low as 1.7$ a few months ago, and having traded on average around 2.3$ for most of the year. Unless something supernatural happens, we will not see below 4$ anymore.

For an optimal mid-term entry point, anything below <4$ is considered a steal, with loading up at 5$ or higher no slouch either. We predict that in the short term stock will rise at the very least above 6.5$, with a potential to break 10$ once Phase 1 is fully concluded and construction is at full swing.

# This writer’s opinion

Speaking long-term, we are looking at a ten bagger here if you were to buy now and everything goes according to plan. With conserative estimates ranging at around +40$, that is if we use the company’s own predicted 7$ FCF at full operations to estimate a realistic share price. Any share picked up at <10$ will be a steal when operations are in full swings and deliveries are being made.

So here’s the big question, do you believe in the leadership’s ability to succeed? Because if you do, this is your chance to end up at the right side of history when the remark “Man I should’ve bought TELL when it was 5$” pops up.

150,Xl is crushed by the shorties if you look at the dd you can see what they did dd by u/stockgang_,"$XL could be a 1,000%+ Gainer 🚀💸 - Solid Fundamentals - Slammed by SHORTS - Large short float

I’ve been following this name for the last few weeks as we broke down 78% from the ATH put in December 2020. Dropping from $34 to $6 , This was no doubt due SPACs getting hammered across the board and the short seller report from Muddy waters posting a lot of misleading information.

In December Citron actually went bullish on the stock issuing a $60 pt.

Both the technicals and fundamentals are now extremely lined for a squeeze with heavy shorts being trapped.

**Basic Stats:**

Market Cap: $1b

Public Float 94.4m

Shares Short: 22.11M

Share Float Short: 23.3%

32 days of consolidation at lows meaning an extremely strong base has been put in at this price. Everybody has been shorting during this period is now trapped.

Vanguard loaded up 6,000,000 extra shares with some other funds increasing their positions.

Possible entry into the Russel Index which would see far more cash flow into the name.

On the 26th March 2021 a total of 205,641 shares were awarded to employees at an estimated cost price of $6.81; With a one year lock up. Giving them a massive incentive to hit targets.

XL recently bought WEES in a 50/50 cash and stock deal which again in my opinion is a great buy. World Energy generated $18 million in total revenue and was free cash flow positive for full year 2020. Its acquisition, which closed Monday, is expected to expand XL Fleet’s electric vehicle charging infrastructure capabilities, the company said

XL recently inked a deal with UBS arena to provide charging stations, solar generation and energy storage. For a total of 1,000 charging stations which is one of the largest deployments in the United States. 

The company they inked the deal with also owns another 30 properties. Meaning more contracts is a very likely outcome.

They also announced that to cover their current clients who consist of names like Fedex, Coca Cola, Pepsi etc they would need to install over 100,000 charging stations making them the biggest player in the industry.

100's of millions sitting in cash

Finally a Short Float of 23.3% approx 22,000,000 shares short. For a comparison this is more than $AMC and $BB.

The market cap and share float are so small that the room for an explosive move is enormous. 

I'm personally looking for a minimum of Shitrons target at $60 a share and based on current future projections 

This is of course not financial advice and I'm long, will be buying more dips.

151,Shorting is not bad / not going away,"As a 20+ year daytrader I thought I just weigh-in with this fact: 
shorting is an indispensable tool of the financial markets. 

As a 60/40 short biased trader, I’m not saying that for my self-interest. I can, and do, make money both directions each and every day. I’m saying it because this sub (WSB) has (rightly or wrongly) been ascribed an aversion to, and a desire to abolish, the ability to short stocks. 

Everyone should be against NAKED short selling. That is an abomination that should absolutely be stomped out - and I also believe it is rampant. Naked short selling makes a mockery of the entire market and I’m proud the apes are finally on the verge of exposing it to the world. 

Every time I’ve been asked in my life what shorting a stock means, I’ve gone through the same numerous factors that make shorting possible: and they always include locating shares to borrow, and paying a fee if necessary, to initiate the position. The idea that institutions are filling retail buy orders with shares that don’t even exist really blows my mind and should shake the faith of all market participants. 
 
But retail and institutional investors being able to short stocks they feel are highly overvalued really does serve to prevent the pervasive & consistent mis-pricing of assets. This prevents small groups of persons/entities from ‘cornering the market’ on numerous low float illiquid stocks (and others). And of course there’s the liquidity argument. And on and on blah blah.

It's been weeks since I've been outside, there is very little out there that interests me. All I need, is to make orange juice.

I look over my shoulder, and I see the table and chairs, but in my mind, the words come out as $TBLEnCHERS. I pick up my phone, I open Robinhood, my orange juicy fingers press my Ulta secure 4 digit passcode.

I think to myself that ""to press"" is just like ""to squeeze"", and my fingers ""squeeze"" the search bar. I search ""short interest, $TBLEnCHERS"" nothing comes up.

Someone is banging on my door, I think to myself that banging on a door is alot like ""squeezing your fist on a door"" 

Orange juice runs down the counter, it pools on the floor. I can tell the person squeezing on my $FRNTDORR is not the man who delivers my oranges, so I ignore it.

My eyes squeeze over to the pile of cases in the corner, all of them full of  $ORNGE that I invested in. I smile, and the slice of $ORNGE falls from my mouth, juicy and wet. Some of my teeth fall out with it, so I search $TEETHS on Webull. Maybe $TEETHS is going to squeeze.

I wounder if Cicadas eat $ORNGE, I panic, have i missed a financial opportunity? what if I missed the squeeze.

Why am I doing this again? The thought squeezes through my brain like a chonky green candlestick, and gets shorted from my mind just as fast.

In the corner a pile of $ORNGEPELS finally avalanches down, breaking a window, ""squeezing"" a window. The sunshine colored water is pouring down the counter, over the floor, my ankles, the sink is clogged with Investment Opportunity.

It washes away my crayon drawing, my careful charting, the squiggly green and red, up and down lines I've covered the floor with, all my carefully crafted DD, washes away.

154,Trading the SPY 0DTE: What I’ve learned and the questions that remain.,"Hello! So I’ve been trading the SPY 0DTE for two months now. I’ve been up %150, down %96 and then back again. It’s been a lot of fun and I’ve learned a lot from it. I’d like to share some of my observations and see what opinions others have on this monumentally stupid trade!

Why Do I Like the SPY 0DTE? Honestly I feel less confident in trying to predict long term prices on anything these days. SPY has been so incredibly range bound that weekly or monthly options seem like a pure theta play. Hence why I like the 0DTE. If you can find one good trend for the day, your tendies will come. But only if you follow these rules:

1. Get in and get out! 
I like to just pop in for a %10 gain and then get the hell out of there. In fact my biggest loss occurred when I thought I could milk out a higher gain. I was in a bull trap and it never came back. The 0DTE is a wave, you can ride it but if you don’t get out of it’s way it will kill you.

2. Find an indicator that works for you.
This sub isn’t crazy about TA, and understandably so. But coin flipping to find your momentum for the day is even worse. So YouTube some different strategies and see what works best for you. Personally, I really like using the 2 supertrends. I also learned to love Heikin Ashi with MAs and a really neat little indicator called Prings Special K (invented by a ketamine enthusiast lol)

3. Sell slightly below the ask price.
I got burned for a %25 loss today after Robinhood couldn’t fill my order. This can happen on such a tight timeframe and especially if you are approaching the end of a price move. I was fortunate in that I was able to salvage my account by selling it for slightly less than the asking price and my order was filled immediately.

Now a %10 gain might not sound like fun after what this sub has been experiencing for the past week, but a month of hitting these 0DTEs will double your account. My best streak was 15, hoping I can get there again.

Does anyone else’s trade this? If so what have been your biggest lessons learned?",154

What do you guys think about this?

I’m putting my bullishness into FCEL. This company currently has a market capacity in the realm of $3.77 Billion. And for full disclosure, I just bought in the other day, currently sitting only on 100 shares, but planning to increase by next week to 500 or 1,000 shares.

• Highlighted Fundamentals (from Q4 2020)-

1. Market Cap - \~$3.65Bn
2. 4th Qtr Revenue- Increased 54% to $17Mill
3. 4th Qtr Net Loss- Decreased nearly 50% ($18.9mill compared to $35.2mill in 2019)
4. Revenues increased 17% to $70.9million
5. Total Assets increased in Q4 2020 to $523,538,000 from $333,446,000 in Q4 2019
6. Liabilities Increased marginally Q4 2020 to $269,133,000 from $197,852,000 (primarily due to projects and expansion)• Operating Expenses-One thing I like a lot is that the Administrative and selling expenses decreased from $31,874,000 to $26,644,000... This factor tied with increased revenues means the company can identify areas to trim unnecessary expenses, all while increasing the company’s absolute value.

• A couple negatives:

1. Out of the 4 international offices/locations, only 1 of them is company owned, the remainder are leased properties (though many corporations lease properties)
2. The company’s financials do not show any product sales data for 2020, however revenue mainly consists of service agreements and license revenues.

• FCEL company future:

1. The company has a promising future which repeated US Gov’t grants for research/development, commercialization and other necessities for energy-type requests; which includes: (1) Advancing High Efficiency Power Generation, (2) Advancing High Efficiency Electrolysis \[this will help produce hydrogen more efficiently and from Water\].
2. 2. FCEL had entered into a joint development agreement with ExxonMobil3. Recently announced to join Hydrogen Europe, which will allow locations in the EU to utilize the company’s fuel cell platforms for clean energy.

In relation to other energy focused companies (such as PLUG), FCEL is priced considerably less, with even smaller Market Capacity. When compared specifically to PLUG (which had an EPS of -$1.46 vs FCEL’s -$0.37), I would be tempted to think FCEL has a lot of potential upside, especially given the near future in relation to clean energy.

When FCEL reaches PLUG’s Market Cap, the price per share will be $53.84.  That is a potential upside of 460%.  

FCEL's Q1 Report comes out on 6/11.  Volume has been sustaining this week, as long as it meets/exceed previous Q4 2020, there's a good chance it can climb back into the mid $20's to $30's.",157

163,CLOV - Big Daddy of All Squeezes DD,"I want to start off by saying this is not a post comparing CLOV to GME or AMC. While these stocks have some similarities, particularly being targeted by hedge funds for short squeezes, I’m not going to get into that. This post is for anyone who is somewhat new to investing, still learning about shorts and squeezes, and those of you who are more knowledgeable but want the full picture of what’s going on with this stock. You can also think of this post as a Part 2 to [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CLOV/comments/ngesez/this_is_the_bottom_and_youll_be_top_of_the_world/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Brief description of my last post - it was about the stock reaching its bottom at $6.80 and only going up from there (which was correct).

**TL;DR - Currently, the highest number of options purchased have a strike price between $7-18 for every single month. The goal is to stay above $12 to create a snowball of options being executed, thereby causing a gamma squeeze - the higher the strike price, the higher the limit to execute and the hedges are worse off.**

**What Is Clover Health?**

Clover Health is not just another insurance company. They have combined Medicare insurance services with new patient-centered technology aimed at facilitating the ease and effectiveness of diagnosis, treatment, and most importantly, prevention. This company should not be classified as a health insurance company, but a tech company. Their AI learning and database, Clover Assistant, make it easier for providers to eliminate unnecessary and repetitive lab testing, repetitive diagnoses, and it consolidates a patient’s medical history into one platform. This not only saves the patient headaches from navigating our decentralized healthcare system, but it also saves both patients and insurance companies an enormous amount of money by avoiding duplicated efforts. 

Currently, CLOV covers 66,300 customers across 8 states out of the 61,212,247 Medicare beneficiaries nationwide, which equates to .0011% of the beneficiary population. As you can tell, this number is extremely low, which makes sense since they are a brand new company. When they reach even 1% of the beneficiaries, this company’s stock price would be $100+ based on fundamentals alone. But I expect these numbers to skyrocket as they gain more members and their AI learning database improves more and more.

[CLOV Medicare Advantage Plan by &#37; of growth compared to competitors \(cloverhealth.com\)](https://preview.redd.it/wuoalim07q371.png?width=3297&format=png&auto=webp&s=b38cba4adeb4fcbbeae5d53ea93751964480113a)

CLOV has huge long-term growth potential, so the risk to reward is extremely favorable towards getting into the squeeze. Let me explain why.

**Positive Catalysts**

All the negative catalysts are out of the way and everything is priced in. Here are some positives I’m keeping an eye on: 

* DOJ/SEC case dropping or settling (even if CLOV is found guilty of taking advantage of Medicare, it will still be positive because at max they’ll pay a fine and that’ll be over with). I highly doubt CLOV will be found guilty though because the Hindenburg claims are rather baseless and the DOJ were forced to inquire about this only because it’s related to Medicare. 
* Biden’s health care proposal reducing the Medicare qualifying age below 65 would create millions of new beneficiaries. The hype around the proposal alone will create a huge stock price increase in all healthcare-related stocks, so CLOV will definitely benefit.
* CLOV is officially added to the Russell 3000, who will have to purchase a ton of CLOV shares.
* PR of any new partnership, expanding to further states, and increasing current partnerships. They’re growing rapidly as is, so news like this is bound to come out in the near future.

**The Dark Clouds Surrounding CLOV**

* As previously mentioned, the DOJ inquiry is still lingering and it’s unclear when it will be settled. Although it’s priced in, it is still something to watch out for.
* Hindenturd’s constant attacks despite insisting they don’t have any positions. Why would Hindenburg attack Chamath Palihapitiya even though they aren’t benefiting from it, according to themselves? This relates to the GME/AMC squeeze; Chamath was a big proponent of the push against the hedges. He was outspoken about the squeeze on several occasions and gave GME his validation, which in turn hurt Citadel and other hedges shorting GME immensely. Hindenburg’s report was created to hurt all of Chamath’s IPOs, especially CLOV. Basically, this is retaliation against Chamath for standing with the retail investors, and if I had to take a wild guess, Citadel has paid Hindenburg to write this baseless report. I’ve added a link at the bottom of this post about the Hindenburg allegations and the counter from CLOV for those who were not aware of all the allegations. (PS - Despite all the negative press surrounding Chamath, his track record is stellar.)
* The constant manipulation by short sellers to create negative incentive. For instance, the fake lawsuits by Lifshitz that are shady at best; if you go to their website, you’ll find the phone number listed goes straight to voicemail. All their social media lead to Wix.com platforms instead of their own. And, **THEIR PHYSICAL LOCATION DOES NOT EXIST** as shown in Google Maps. Lots of red flags.

**Let’s get down to the nitty gritty - The Daddy of all Short Squeezes**

CLOV is currently over 42.58% as of Friday, making it the highest shorted stock on paper (and it’s unclear how many naked shorts there are, which could easily be 70-100%+; it’s impossible to know since those shares are shorted illegally). THE SQUEEZE IS INEVITABLE, it’s just a matter of how much more the short interest increases, which will correlate to a bigger squeeze. Furthermore, the borrowed interest on CLOV stock has more than doubled to 3.7%, meaning those who are shorting have to pay much higher interest on borrowing the stocks, and that number will only continue to increase as demand increases. Soon, they won’t be able to borrow anymore stocks and will have to short it naked in order to suppress the price further, essentially digging a gargantuan hole in which to bury themselves.

[CLOV S\/I&#37; as reported by Ortex](https://preview.redd.it/yem0laz57q371.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0602994d6bc0ddc1305c2737a8b1d70de3f7c58)

No need to fear the company dumping their shares or diluting it because the Class B shares are locked up - the directors aren’t able to sell any shares until the stock price stays above $30 for 90 consecutive days or more. The company is $700 million cash flow positive and no debt, therefore there won’t be any dilution.

The P/S ratio is considered a particularly good metric for evaluating young, potentially high growth companies or companies in cyclical industries that may not show an actual net profit every year. Let’s talk about CLOV’s P/S ratio for a moment. 

CLOV’s 2020 revenue was $672.9 million compared to $462.3 million in 2019, which puts it at 45.6% increase in growth. They beat their own expectations and those of analysts by a wide margin. In 2018 and 2019, the market valued tech companies with IPOs at an average of 11.7 and 10.4 times (respectively) their previous 12 month earnings. Conservatively, that would put CLOV at $7 billion market cap, which is around $20+ fair value. But in 2020, that number doubled, which would increase CLOV’s market cap significantly. However, for this consideration, I’m using the 2018/19 valuation to be conservative.

**Bottom Line**

The fair value of CLOV is anywhere from $20-30 fundamentally, which makes it a very risk-free, undervalued stock that has been suppressed by short sellers. But this post is not about the fundamentals - this is about exposing the short sellers’ manipulation of CLOV. On paper, this company is shorted 42.58% (though this is MUCH higher when you include the illegal naked shorts that aren’t reported), making it the highest shorted stock as of Friday. This number could go much higher as short sellers continue to borrow stocks and suppress the price further, which only hurts them more the longer this is shorted. As is common knowledge from previous squeezes, hedge funds are not going to cover anytime soon; they have to be forced by triggering their margins. As the Fed hinted recently, hedge funds are the most leveraged they’ve ever been in the last 20 years, which means retail investors can take advantage of them just like they’ve been taking advantage of retail investors for 100s of years.

I don’t know how much it could squeeze, from $50-150 or much higher, and there’s no telling where the ceiling will end up. The squeeze is inevitable, whether you or I buy it or not, but the process of how long it will take is up to the retail investing community.

168,$BB - Expect Large Movements Within 1 Month - Part 6," Welcome back to another episode of ""Can Virtual-Pin1025 Predict the Future?""  
After Friday's action, the conclusion is no, but let's look at the chart and see what's going on.

What happened on Friday:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x2wmukqxbp371.png?width=1916&format=png&auto=webp&s=01459ffc0e98d47ef446f563fcf853f0fff36af1

The first real red day in 2 weeks lost support at the $14.50 USD mark but also had reduced volume. Can't win them all. We should consider this pullback extremely healthy and does not interfere with the overall bull trend as we were exceeding the Bollinger bands for 5 straight trading days. Exceeding the Bollinger bands is considered to be a strong indicator of volatility, and I strongly believe we have more volatility to come. I would also assume traders were taking their anywhere from 60%-100% profits off the table.

We did not bounce back up to the $24-$33 range as I expected on Friday, but again opinions are like assholes. Everyone has one. I believe that range is easily accessible still through this coming trading week.

Signs that make me bearish:  
\-1D chart RSI is still quite high but is reaching back into a healthy range.  
\-Lower volume Friday. But the overall market was low and red so I'm not too concerned.  
\-Gap to be filled on the chart. \~$11.56-12.30. Usually, gaps do get filled on charts but not always in the short term.  
\-Loss of the 14.50 support. On the hourly chart we had a small bounce in that range on Thursday after the massive opening and slightly recovered, a bounce again just after open on Friday but ultimately failed for the rest of the day. This is a volume issue and many taking profits/losses trying to swing trade.  
\-Possibility of reaching $12.10, if that fails next stop is probably \~$11.30

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nvjhe4fybp371.png?width=1811&format=png&auto=webp&s=817de62d8aedc2eacb1a9bcbbb5e3ac73bf1a80e

These are the bearish signals that I can find and are important to note but again the overall bull trend still exists on a daily, and when in doubt zoom out is the motto. One bad day does not mean you have a bad life.

Signs that make me bullish:  
\-We ended the day inside the top end of the Bollinger bands and they appear to not be contracting yet on the daily chart.  
\-20 DMA and 50DMA have just crossed. This is called a golden cross and the 200DMA is now beginning to slope upwards.  
\-Large amount of strength in the $13.00 range. If you look back at the hourly chart above where we ended Friday you can see where it is flat in comparison to on Wednesday. This shows strong support in this range and will be a powerful foundation to build a cup and handle formation. This range was also significant in the previous run in January

&#x200B;

\-Still a large following and people interested in $BB this weekend across forums, subreddits, and media. #1 ticker on WSB Thursday and Friday.  
\-Largest open interest of stock options is $20 USD.  
\-Put/call ratio still relatively low  
\-Small short shares available (Squeeze is in the realm of possibilities again)  
\-RSI looks healthy on the hourly for a dead cat bounce at open  
\-Currently, one of the best plays technically speaking but also fundamentally for the long term (1-2 years+).  
\-I have confirmation bias because cybersecurity is a massive growth market. If you didn't hear, JBS is the world's largest supplier of beef, and got hacked might actually cause a shortage of beef in the supermarkets or a large squeeze in beef prices. Go long on beef and cybersecurity.  
\-Institutions are still accumulating. Remember, around 48% of BB is owned by institutions and insiders. This is massive. One of the largest companies with large institutional ownership is Microsoft at \~70% or Facebook with an %80. We aren't that far off with a much much lower share count.

If the share price goes down significantly tomorrow I'll post another update, only because if the share price goes down with such a small amount of short shares available I believe this will only be tightening the slingshot further that would rocket $BB's share price to the $30s.

Things that we need to continue to look for:  
\-High volume  
\-Amount of posts and articles about $BB on Reddit, commercial websites, and other forums  
\-News or statements from $BB. One piece of news that's significant could be the catalyst to a moonshot.

This week's price target remains the same as what I wanted on Friday. Anywhere $24-$33USD.

Take care, and stay healthy. Go drink some water, please.",168
169,NVDA 4-1 stick split,"
Hello you apes,

Here it is NVDA is primed and ready to go to the moon, but the shorts are at it again. They are suppressing this stock from sky rocketing today. The news is out, but not on main stream yet. The 4-1 stock split was approved if you look at the press release from NVDA they say the split was approved by the board and it was contingent under Question 4, if Question 4 was approved then that means it would go through. So the 4-1 split is here! But people just don’t know about it yet. The big boys are holding us back. Please send help. Question 4 was approved in the 8-K. The link for the proxy questions is below.

# Products & Customers

* BlackBerry isn't just a phone company any more. They provide best in class cybersecurity.
* BlackBerry's most notable product is QNX, an RTOS with several applications. [Read here for more.](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le53ol/comprehensive_guide_about_bb_and_how_it_shall/)
* In December of last year, Amazon announced a multi-year global agreement with BlackBerry QNX and developed IVY, a cloud-connected smart vehicle data platform. IVY allows automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data and create actionable insights from that date. It's possibilities are endless, and I highly recommend reading more on Amazon's initial announcement.
* OK, so what the fuck does the point above mean? It means that **right now, electric vehicles are a gold rush, and BlackBerry is the one selling picks and shovels.** Through Amazon, IVY is going to become an integral part of the EV process.
* The market is sucking the dick of EV manufacturers, but EV production is low margin and low scale. **BlackBerry IVY is data monetization, which is high margin and has unlimited scale.** Within a few years, BlackBerry will be making much more than the auto manufacturers they're partnered with.
* Blackberry QNX is used by 23 of the world's top 25 electric vehicle OEMs.
* BlackBerry targets more than just EVs though. They also have or are developing products for healthcare, financial services, government markets, energy, gas, oil, and smart grid connected transportation.

# Cybersecurity Leader

* BB offers best-in-class security, safety, and reliability. 18 of the G20 governments are customers, and they are the only software company to attain various security certifications from the US Govt.
* Ransomware attacks have begun to impact American businesses like never before. Today, the commerce secretary stated ransomware attacks are here to stay, and that businesses should plan accordingly.
* You know that oil pipeline that was taken out by DarkSide ransomware and caused oil shortages across the southeast U.S? That wouldn't have happened if Colonial Pipeline were using BlackBerry. Something tells me companies won't be making that mistake in the future.
* According to Frost & Sullivan Research, BlackBerry addresses 96% of cyber threats, and 77% of Fortune 100 financial companies use BlackBerry software.

[Here's a list of BB Certifications obtained in 2020.](https://preview.redd.it/qey899yxnp371.png?width=1259&format=png&auto=webp&s=f51e571ce7afcaf17126b2c168cb3f7a37343c35)

# Some Basics and Fundamentals

* BlackBerry has an \~$8bn market cap with $1bn+ in yearly revenue and $800m in cash.
* Since 2016, the number of QNX products has grown from 50 million to 175 million.
* BB owns \~38,000 patents worth approximately $450 million.
* BB recently won a lawsuit against Facebook. I am unable to find the details, but most estimates are for between $1bn - $5bn total, paid over the course of a few years. BlackBerry's current market cap is only $8bn...
* Blackberry has a strong customer base of critical infrastructure already, and their pivot from hardware to software means continuous subscription revenue.
* **If BlackBerry had the same market cap as competitor Crowdstrike -** **who it outperforms** **- it would have a stock price of $83.** That's just taking into consideration one aspect of it's business model.
* [Vanguard has doubled their position since Dec 31/2020.](https://np.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lzw0pn/vanguard_is_bullish_on_bb/)

# TL;DR: 🚀🚀🚀 BB is going past the moon and into Alpha Centauri. This company is so much more than a meme stock or a short term squeeze - it's a life changing opportunity. When BlackBerry starts getting IVY revenue, $20 will look like a joke and you'll have to explain to your wife's boyfriend why you didn't get in under $14 when you had the chance.

# BIG EDIT:

**I was asked about the bear case for BB. It's important to understand the risks of investing, and I'm not so in love with this stock that I'm blind, so here's the bear case:**

* A lot of investors have been underwhelmed by revenue so far, and BlackBerry missed their expectations for Q4 2020. But it's worth noting the reason for buying BlackBerry right now is that when IVY revenue starts rolling in these concerns will wash away. It's a longer term play, similar to Palantir.
* The bull case assumes CEO John Chen's estimate of being able to get roughly $500m for their patents is correct. If they get less than expected for that side of their business, or keep the patents and aren't able to monetize them in a meaningful way, that would be less than ideal.
* The Facebook settlement could end up being more like 500m than the 2bn+ that's expected.
* They could be passed in the cybersecurity field before they are able to leverage their current best in class service. This one is really unlikely considering how many other companies have tried to make products equivalent to what BlackBerry has - and failed.
* EV companies could end up making their own OS and data services to resist IVY adoption. Several are trying (Tesla always comes in this conversation as an example), but from everything I've read none have managed to make as safe and comprehensive a system as BlackBerry.

So, *if* IVY doesn't get adopted, they're no longer the leading cybersecurity company, their lawsuit is for less money than expected, and their patents are actually worthless - then BlackBerry is only a little undervalued instead of incredibly undervalued.

**Here's the most meaningful bear case right now though, and how the bulls can beat it:**

There seems to be a lot of upward resistance. Establishments, institutions, etc. are all convinced BB is a failed phone company stock worth $10. When it rises, large financial players short (because they believe they can buy back for $10 or less), buy puts, or just scalp to try and capitalize on the volatility which in turn creates a lot of resistance and breaks momentum.

I don't think there's any conspiracy, I think the big players are just incompetent. These are pretty normal pullbacks and reactions to a stock that's gaining so quickly. The problem is that those big financial players I mentioned (as well as a lot of people on WSB) don't understand *why* this stock is so desirable. They just think it's a meme stock that's being pumped and don't understand the potential of: A) Becoming an essential step of EV manufacturing; B) Being best in class security during an age of ransomware attacks. So instead of getting in and riding the momentum, they create a self fulfilling prophecy of pullbacks.

**The bulls can win the same way we've won in GME and AMC - by buying and holding. Continued days of large volume will completely fuck the bears who started taking huge short positions last week, leading to even bigger price movement. Buying shares or LEAPS and being patient is the way to play it and win big.** The bears win when bulls waste all their capital buying FDs that have no chance of finishing ITM or when they see a dip and paper hand their shares. It's funny to watch people freak out at a $2 dip when they easily could have just hedged that with a deep OTM weekly covered call. **Buy** ➡️ **Hold** ➡️  **Yacht**

Regardless of the resistance that exists at the moment, there will come a day when big finance starts racing to get in on BB - and they'll pretend they were right all along. We've seen it constantly in tech stocks over the past few years. WSB can just expedite the inevitable by getting in on BB while it's still incredibly cheap.",171

What Happened: Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities, told CNBC that investors in the so-called stonks, or shares favored by the retail crowd, must focus on May’s consumer price index (CPI) that will be reported Thursday.

The CPI data could be a catalyst for the U.S. Federal Reserve to reverse its easy monetary policy. The Fed’s next monetary policy meeting is scheduled for June 15-June 16.

Noting that the market looks too expensive, Massocca said that while the retail trading mania is just one sign, a hawkish comment from the Fed could also trigger a sell-off. He believes the market is setting up for a 7% to 10% pullback at some point.

“Who knows what starts it. ... One of the candidates very likely will be some kind of reductions in monetary policy,” the analyst reportedly said.

**DESCRIPTION**

Charge Point is an electric infrastructure company that designs, develops & manufactures hardware & software solutions for electric vehicles at large. It offers a portfolio of hardware, software, & services for corporate, public, & residential customers. Company was founded in 2007 and operates in 14 countries.

**History**

In June 2017, $CHPT took over 9,800 electric vehicle charging spots from GE. Prior to that point, $CHPT managed 34,900 charging stations across Mexico, Australia, Canada, and the United States.

The current CEO and president as of 2018 is Pasquale Romano. On November 28, 2018, $CHPT raised $240 million. At the time, $CHPT maintained 57,000 charging spots. In 2019, VW's [Electrify America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrify_America) and $CHPT agreed to provide common access to their US customers. Company reached 100,000 chargers in September 2019, while adding more than 2,000 charging locations per month. Currently $CHPT offers 132k charging station network. Which accounts for 72% market share of total level 2 charging in North America. New entity was formed from Legacy Charge Point combined with Switchback late Feb 2021;

**What is the business model of CHPT?**

Charge Point sells hardware & software (equipment & network subscriptions) to property owners. The company doesn't own the majority of stations. It doesn't monetize energy. It only monetizes the driver, thus capital light business model.

**BUSINESS OVERVIEW**

* Market Cap: \~$7bn
* Shares Float 299mln
* Institutional ownership \~13%
* 2 Year CAGR Revenue Growth 65.65%; 5 Year 60%;

$CHPT enjoys the [largest share](https://investors.chargepoint.com/why-invest/default.aspx) of Level 2 chargers in the US. Data from [AFDC](https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/analyze?fuel=ELEC) shows that $CHPT wields the largest market share at 42.8K L2 chargers out of 92.8K total of which 11.5K are ""non-networked"", carving \~53% market share of ""networked"" chargers. No 2 competitor is Tesla with 16.8K, No3 largest, is SemaCharge Network at 5.2K, followed by Blink with 3.1k which is 4th. In terms of L3 'Superchargers', where Tesla leads the way with 10.7k of 19.6k units. $CHPT is competitive with 1.5k with only Electrify America coming in higher at 2.5k. Superchargers account for \~22% of the market pie, L2 \~75% and L1, \~3% of market share. People keep reiterating that L3 is the future and no one should bother with L1 & L2. Well, that's wrong. L3 is obviously the option for the highways, commercial and service transportation. Even larger segment though is found at: parking lots, restaurants, cinemas, sports arenas, malls, corporate offices and other mass conglomerations. This is where L2 comes to play much cheaper than L3 to install, but with longer charging times - perfect fit.

**Products**

Comprehensive Hardware Portfolio Delivers - Solutions for every use case, all vehicle types and brands - High efficiency in power and footprint - Modular, scalable, secure architecture designed for serviceability- Unparalleled quality; advanced testing (vehicle, functional, climate, environment) for long-term reliability - Options for site hosts to use custom branding

**Software Enables** \- Control of who can use stations and when - All vehicles to get charged on time - Multiple vehicles to share power - Drivers to get in line when ports are occupied- Roaming integrations with other charging networks

**Challengers**

* $VLTA; Claims to go beyond just charging EVs, their chargers are used for ads and their charger placement is based on data analytics in collaboration with $PLTR. When company compares itself to the competition, they do it all - they own the gear, they sell the electricity, they provide software and networks, they do fancy data things, they do advertising. The things they don't do, are manufacture and sell the chargers. They cherry-pick a bunch of stats to show that their chargers have better ""engagement"" but given they only have 1.7k Level 2s & 6 L3. It's like chargers-as-billboards, selected to prime locations. *Anyone can replicate it, if it provides substantial revenue boost, competitors will emulate it*.
* SemmaConnect: Company boasts 3rd largest market share of L2 chargers. SemmaConnect also manufactures chargers and sell software. SemaConnect chargers are OCPP compliant. Sema appears not to have a L3 offering, nor do they appear to offer sales to individuals (single-family residential).
* $EVGO; EVgo claims to have made the first 150kW and 350kW L3 chargers, and base their business largely on L3 chargers. AFDC data says they only have 403 L2s but 1.4k L3 which garners 4th market share. Company also offers drivers a membership for reduced charging rates (\~0.04/min assuming you spend 7.99/month) and they have integrated Tesla connectors on their newer L3. EVgo also has a nationwide infrastructure roll-out deal with GM and are entirely powered by renewables. What differentiates the company is the L3 focus.
* $BLNK: Overhyped POP stock. Blink sells L2 and L3 chargers to business and individuals. Claims to operate on an owner/operator model. From EC:*""The Company made continued progress with its owner/operator strategy; the number of commercial Blink-owned charging stations contracted or deployed during the quarter grew by 51% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period.""*
* $VWAGY Subsidiary:(Electrify America): L3 focused company, it enjoys 2.5k L3 chargers. EM also sells a L2 for the home. EM offers an app, membership for drivers with a monthly fee that gets you a good discount on their charging costs. The membership and cost to charge suggests that they own their chargers. EM also have an electric vehicle subscription service and have some relationships with Jeep and Hyundai. All its reports seem to be released to the California Air Resources Board. Company doesn't appear to build their own chargers, instead relying on procurement, using third-party hardware and software.

**Near Term Catalysts**

In relation to upcoming US government infrastructure bill: ""AlixPartners estimates $300 billion will be needed to build out a global charging network to accommodate the expected growth of EVs by 2030, including $50 billion in the U.S. alone.""

It's not too late to make bets on upcoming infrastructure bill. Yes you can dabble into construction firms and commodity plays, but you don't know which companies will win lucrative contracts and sizes of those contracts. Well the biggest companies you might say? It's not that clear cut. What is clear cut, is that the focal point of this infrastructure bill is transition to renewable energy and overhaul of pivotal infrastructure. $CHPT has the most experienced (14yrs) company with largest manufacturing capacity, technical know how and ability to take on large scale projects like, building hundreds of thousands of charging stations across all states (500k by 2030). Oh yeah one more thing, former $CHPT board member is in current administration.

That's only US. $CHPT operates infrastructure in the hub of world's renewable energy aka Europe. (Also, Canada, Australia, UK, Mexico among other places) You find yourself at the erection of the infrastructure that you and your kids will be utilizing down the road. Just like, railways, roads, telcoms and internet.

**Long Term Catalysts**

\- Fossil fuel bans - Transit electrification dates - Incentive programs - All major auto OEM brands committed to electric + Further EV cost reductions with advances in battery technology.

$CHPT Growth Directly Proportional to EV Penetration, $CHPT Estimated $1B Revenue at 3% EV Penetration.

**Miscellaneous**

$CHPT Apple Store rating: 4.6.

$CHPT also has the #1 bestselling home charging station on Amazon with hundreds of 5 star reviews.

$CHPT offers access to hundreds of thousands of places to charge with one account via proprietary app.

In collaborations with Daimler, Toyota, BMW, Siemens etc.

No1 choice for Fortune 500 companies. Customers include: Google, Target, IKEA, NASA, GM, Pepsico, Disney, McDonalds, FedEx, Stanford etc.

Shareholders lock up period ends on September 1st.

**MOAT**

* First Mover Advantage (With 14 years of experience in a nascent industry, this is where big contracts will go)
* Asset light business model ( Selective ownership of charge stations, outsources maintenance & responsibilities to the owner)
* Economies of Scale ( $CHPT has largest manufacturing capacity)
* Network Effect ( \~75% of charging network market share & operations in 14 countries)

**CONCLUSION**

All in all $CHPT stock is a pure EV exposure, with light CapEx business model. Company is the ecosystem player with defensible MOATs, recurring revenue streams and visibility. $CHPT finds itself in green friendly category and attracts premium valuation due to penetrance in multiple domains: EV Ecosystem (Hardware), Software Powered Solutions and Energy Technology.  Yes most of its network is L2 chargers, but it's where most of the money is to be made. As users go to restaurants, malls, sports events/concerts, office, cinema, universities or just a Parking Lot! There will be L2 charger not L3 due to: Charger Cost Basis/Time Parked. Pretty straightforward formula.

**Why am I interested in $CHPT?**

Because it's an entrenched leader with tremendous experience in a nascent industry.

Because it's a clever business model based on light assets which will subsequently offer high margins 5 years from now. And is literally replacement of GAS stations no matter what happens! And is a home ""GAS station"".

Because EVs are the future and I am catching the momentum and inevitable supremacy and prevalence of charging stations.

A small market cap in the market that will explode no matter what.

This is really well rounded company with superb fundamentals & \~13% institutional ownership, what's going to happen to the stock when institutions commence adoption of it? Let me use a technical term you''ll understand, the valuation will go - bananas.

179,"No, 100% TQQQ is probably not a great idea. Here's why.","A couple months ago I cross-posted what I thought was a [neat illustration](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/mco57x/how_much_gains_it_takes_to_recover_from_market/) (below) showing why drawdowns matter sometimes, and thus why a 100% TQQQ (3x QQQ) portfolio is probably not optimal.

Then I've also seen a few posts like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/modli5/tqqq_is_an_excellent_long_term_investment_even/) recently praising a 100% TQQQ position.

Many incorrectly posit that TQQQ's massive drawdowns simply don't matter because it will always recover. And I even realize why this idea seems intuitive because its leverage would allow it to climb out of the hole faster.

As usual, recency bias is rearing its ugly head.

First, this post has nothing to do with the oft-cited boogeyman of LETFs known as *volatility decay* or *beta slippage* of the fund itself. In short, [it's not as big of a deal as it's made out to be](http://www.ddnum.com/articles/leveragedETFs.php). I'm a fan of LETFs. I use them myself and I *do* ""hold them for more than a day.""

Secondly, this is also ignoring the fact that QQQ is basically a tech fund at this point. The market is already over 1/4 tech, and [Growth is looking expensive](https://www.reddit.com/r/M1Finance/comments/ixpset/great_video_for_those_who_like_to_bet_on_large/). I neither own nor recommend owning QQQ or TQQQ. TQQQ just seems to be very popular and is the subject of most of these LETF posts, but this concept could obviously apply to 100% UPRO as well (which I do own).

Drawdowns are the kryptonite here. Here's that graph I mentioned:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p2vt2i2vcw371.png?width=529&format=png&auto=webp&s=f60ac73b94453fac27093d50a3c313bb4f1ea9ca

As a simplistic example using dollars, suppose your $100 portfolio drops by 10% ($10) to $90. You now require an 11% gain to get back to $100.

The stellar soaring of Big Tech over the past decade has resulted in huge inflows into the fund, and its performance during that time looks fantastic. Here's TQQQ's inception in 2010 through 2020, over which time it's up over 5,000%:

Looks great, right? But as we know, past performance does not indicate future performance. Moreover, a decade – especially one without a major crash – is a terribly short amount of time from which to draw any sort of meaningful conclusions.

So we need to go back further to get a better idea of how TQQQ performs (or *would have* performed, at least) through major stock market crashes. I created some simulation data so that we can do just that by simulating returns going back further than the fund’s inception. Going back to 1987 - when the NASDAQ 100 started - for TQQQ vs. QQQ tells a somewhat different story:

&#x200B;

Notice how buying TQQQ alone is basically a timing gamble that depends heavily on your entry and exit points. Basically, it can take too long for the leveraged ETF to recover after a major crash. After the Dotcom crash of 2000, TQQQ didn’t catch up to QQQ until late 2007 right before it crashed again in the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. Had you bought in January 2000 right before the Dotcom crash, you’d still be in the red today:

So how can we make it work? We need to mitigate those harmful drawdowns. As usual, diversification is your friend, especially with LETFs. As with the famous Hedgefundie Adventure (Google it), TMF (3x long treasuries) should probably be the primary hedge of choice. (Yes, interest rates falling for the past 40 years has resulted in great performance for long bonds. Whether or not long treasuries will provide the same protection in the future that they have in the past is another conversation, but here we're just looking for an insurance policy for crashes via uncorrelation and hopefully *negative* correlation, even in a low/zero/rising rate environment.)

You can extend this idea with other assets like gold, too, obviously, to further lower volatility and mitigate drawdowns, which is what Bridgewater's All Weather Fund attempts to do.

60/40 TQQQ/TMF for effective 180/120 exposure looks the best historically and dominated the funds held in isolation:

# What about regular deposits?

The backtests above use a starting balance of $10,000 and no additional deposits. Some will reflexively point out that an investor will usually be regularly depositing into the portfolio and that this would change the results because you can ""bUy ThE dIpS."" Since the market tends to go up (it spends most of its time at all-time highs) and since major crashes are typically infrequent, regular deposits of $1,000/month actually don't change the end result:

This post will hopefully provide some value to people not familiar with Clover Health (CLOV) and their Medicare Advantage business. CLOV is starting to get a lot of attention because of the addition to the [MSCI index](https://app2.msci.com/eqb/gimi/smallcap/MSCI_May21_SCPublicList.pdf) in May, addition to the [Russell 2000](https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/russell_3000_index_additions_-_2021.pdf) index in June, and the [high short interest](https://fintel.io/ss/us/clov) that could lead to a squeeze. I personally invested in CLOV because of the fundamentals support a $15+ share price.  I'm happy to hold on to this long-term for that reason.

# Full Breakdown of CLOV Valuation

To understand what CLOV should be worth today, look at [OSH](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/OSH/) and [AGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AGL?p=AGL&.tsrc=fin-srch). Not only did all three companies go public within the last year, but they are all similar-sized [Direct Contracting Entities](https://innovation.cms.gov/innovation-models/gpdc-model) (DCE) competing for ""lives under management"" *(Note: you'll see companies report this number using the term patients, members, or beneficiaries. They're all equivalent)*. This term simply means Medicare patients that the company is financially +/- clinically responsible for. Medicare pays $850+ per beneficiary per month for these companies to take on the risk of managing their healthcare costs. You can think of it as a lower margin (5-10% EBITDA) Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model that generates stable recurring revenue on a monthly basis for each patient being managed.

CLOV started out as a Medicare Advantage (MA) insurance plan, which is pretty similar to Direct Contracting (DC). That's because [the DC model was designed based on the MA model](https://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/view/cms-direct-contracting-model---is-it-still-one-of-the-value-based-models-built-on-fee-for-service-chasis-) by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). CMS launched the DC program in April 2021, and CLOV, OSH, and AGL among the first 53 organizations approved.

OSH does a good job of [explaining](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4418419-oak-street-health-bar-of-expectation-may-be-set-little-too-high) how the Medicare Advantage market (and now the DC market) works:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t0utrzxkgp371.png?width=887&format=png&auto=webp&s=f68cd3b940c33b8c41e51c51cd270e8f7208cd8e

MA Plans are insurance companies that partner with specific healthcare providers to help manage the cost of their patients. The MA plan gets the $850+ monthly payment, and is [required by law to spend at least 85%](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2013/05/23/2013-12156/medicare-program-medical-loss-ratio-requirements-for-the-medicare-advantage-and-the-medicare) of it on medical costs. They usually do this by giving 85% of the $850+ monthly payment to the healthcare provider, and thereby transfer the risk of unexpectedly high costs to the provider caring for the patient. The DC model works the same, except Medicare pays the Direct Contracting Entity (DCE) $850+ monthly. What's interesting about DC is that any type of organization can be a DCE. CLOV is an insurance company (MA plan) that creates networks of healthcare providers for their plan members. AGL is a Management Service Organization (MSO) that provides services to healthcare providers that care for Medicare Advantage patients. And OSH *is* a healthcare provider that operates brick-and-mortar clinics focused on Medicare Advantage patients.

Medicare Advantage represents [26 million Americans](https://www.medicareresources.org/medicare-benefits/medicare-advantage/), accounting for about 36 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries. The DC program was launched by CMS so that Medicare Advantage companies like CLOV, AGL, and OSH could help manage the other 46 million Medicare beneficiaries in order to transition away from fee-for-service healthcare. **It's a huge deal.**

Below I'll break down the key numbers driving the valuation of these three companies for their Medicare Advantage business. The DC business is obviously new, but I'll predict what the valuations will look like in DC afterward. **The most important thing to understand here is that the valuation for all three of these companies is the number of lives under management multiplied by a dollar amount. The dollar amount is the market saying how much they believe in the company's ability to profitably manage those patients.**

Disclaimer: I'm not saying all three companies should be valued exactly the same. I am arguing that the dollar amount per managed life should be within a much tighter window because the gross margin for managing a Medicare life (MA or DC) will always end up in a very tight window (5-10% of revenue) no matter what model you deploy.

**OSH = $14.3B market cap**

OSH is obviously liked the most by the market based on their valuation. It's partly because they run the clinics so they can keep more of the Medicare dollar (instead of splitting it with the healthcare provider that takes on the risk). Employing clinicians also allows them to theoretically do more to improve health outcomes and control costs. In this model, the MA Plan takes 15% off the top, and the rest goes to OSH.

* **OSH gross margin = 6.7%** ([source](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/osh/financials))
* **75,500 total managed lives growing to 112,000 this year** ([source](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/oak-street-health-projects-strong-growth-2021-despite-64m-loss-q1))
* **That's a valuation of $125,000 per patient**

**AGL = $14.3B market cap**

AGL holds the contract with the MA plan and then pays the contracted (not employed) healthcare provider. In this model, the MA Plan takes 15% of the premium off the top, and the rest is split between AGL and the provider practices.

* **AGL gross margin = 7%** ([source](https://capital.com/agilon-health-ipo-will-the-stock-soar-in-2021))
* **165,300 total risk-based patients growing to 210,000 this year** ([source](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-agilon-health-ipo/healthcare-platform-agilon-valued-at-about-11-billion-in-nyse-debut-idUSKBN2C22D7))
* **That's a valuation of $66,667 per patient**

**CLOV = $3.65B market cap**

CLOV has historically been just a MA plan, taking the 15% of the premium off the top and paying the rest to cover the patient's costs ([source](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2013/05/23/2013-12156/medicare-program-medical-loss-ratio-requirements-for-the-medicare-advantage-and-the-medicare)). MA plans have an average profit margin of 4.3% after all their admin and sales expenses are accounted for ([source](https://mhk.com/medicare-advantage-is-the-golden-egg-for-health-plans/)).

* **CLOV historical gross margin (before COVID effect) = 2.5-4.1 %** ([source](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/static-files/ed2bc09d-cd96-4759-897e-862c2b250213))
* **132,000 total risk-based patients growing to 160,000 this year** ([source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/17/2230595/0/en/Clover-Health-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results.html))
* **That's a valuation of $22,800 per patient**

**AGL is a good preview of how the DC market could be valued per Medicare patient, except the DC model could be even better. There is no MA plan taking 15% off the top in between the risk-bearer (Direct Contracting Entity: CLOV, AGL, or OSH) and Medicare. Direct Contracting patients could be valued as high as $76,667 (15% premium over current AGL patients).**

The CEO of OSH was recently quoted ""**the per-patient economics of that program will potentially be better than the company had initially estimated""** ([source](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/oak-street-health-projects-strong-growth-2021-despite-64m-loss-q1))**.**

Here are the number of Medicare patients enrolled by each DCE (since the program launched in April 2021):

* **OSH: 6,500** managed lives ([source](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/oak-street-health-projects-strong-growth-2021-despite-64m-loss-q1))
* **AGL**: **50,000** managed lives ([source](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001831097/98fb566d-8f47-4a36-bd48-6bef5745cf56.pdf))
* **CLOV: 65,000** managed lives ([source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/17/2230595/0/en/Clover-Health-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results.html))

Hopefully now those valuation ranges I presented at the top make a little more sense to you.

# Here's an outline of how the Clover Assistant (CA) platform improves treatment decisions and risk adjustment for the provider:

* **More informed doctors delivering better treatment and care**  

   * CA will make treatment recommendations using evidence-based guidelines
   * Primary care providers manage so many different conditions, it's impossible for them to keep up with all the medical literature
   * CA will present the latest evidence-based guidelines as simple recommendations, so that the primary care provider doesn't have to stay up-to-date on the most advanced treatment pathways for every condition
* **More accurate documentation for higher Medicare payments (MA and DC)**  

   * The monthly $850+ payment to MA and DC organizations is adjusted based on the patient's risk score (basically how many health conditions they have)
   * The risk score is calculated using diagnosis codes (ICD-10 codes) that are entered into the electronic health record (EHR) by the doctor and eventually included in the insurance claim that goes to the MA plan (and Medicare)
   * Providers often forget to include all the codes in the insurance claim, or even sometimes forget to properly document it in the EHR
   * Providers also forget to re-document codes on an annual basis, because on January 1 all of the diagnosis codes are erased in Medicare's risk score calculation because some diagnoses can change (e.g. cancer remission)  

      * This sounds stupid, but if a diabetic patient has an amputated foot, Medicare acts like it grows back on Jan 1 and the doctor has to document the diagnosis again
      * Medicare is either too lazy to discern between permanent vs reversible conditions, and/or they like that they get to pay less for an inaccurately lower risk score
   * When providers forget to include one or more codes, that means the risk score will be lower and the premium received by the MA plan will be lower
   * CLOV's software analyzes data from the EHR as well as past claims to identify diagnosis codes that are missing from the current claim, and asks the provider if they still have the condition to see if the doctor simply forgot to document the code
   * CLOV's software also analyzes EHR and claims data to identify potentially missing diagnosis codes and asks the doctor if the patient ever had a certain condition using evidence-based guidelines  

      * Example: blood pressure reading > 140/90 (threshold in hypertension guidelines) but no hypertension diagnosis code documented

# Why is CLOV Undervalued?

**Part 1: Hindenburg Report (February 2021)**

* Hindenburg does research for short hedge funds. The [report](https://hindenburgresearch.com/clover/) revealed a DOJ investigation into CLOV that was previously undisclosed. The day after the report was released, an SEC investigation was initiated into CLOV based on the report. The report had a number of unrelated claims on shady marketing practices, undisclosed business relationships, and ""upcoding"".
* Probably the most serious accusation of them all is the one about ""upcoding"". If this is true, it's Medicare fraud. The number one rule in the Medicare industry is DON'T OVERBILL MEDICARE. In the case of CLOV, I seriously doubt there is any upcoding going on based on how their software works. The Clover Assistant (CA) software doesn't have the ability to change any codes. It just makes recommendations. The doctor has to manually do it for regulatory *and* patient safety reasons. There are other population health tools out there that do this exact thing. Often times when upcoding is being investigated, it's because the Medicare fee-for-service claims suggest a much lower risk score. However, that's because providers don't document most codes in fee-for-service claims because they don't get paid to spend the extra time. When the patient then enrolls in a MA plan or DC program, all of a sudden [their risk score shoots up](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20170519/NEWS/170519815/doj-s-medicare-advantage-lawsuits-investigations-likely-to-change-insurance-culture) because the MA/DC organization and provider get paid based on risk.
* Regarding the other accusations, [CLOV released a point-by-point response](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000119312521029637/d66346dex991.htm) the day after the report came out. I thought they addressed everything sufficiently. From an investor's perspective, it all comes down to what the DOJ finds. I'd be very surprised if Chamath's counsel and the third-party counsel involved in the SPAC ignored or did not look into illegal practices during due diligence. This was one of Chamath's first SPACs and he knew was launching many more. If you mess up due diligence once, the rest of your SPACs become worthless.
* **Regarding the BS about the CEO Vivek Garripali**, he bought 3 hospitals in bankruptcy and assumed their debt almost 10 years ago. He quickly found out why they were in so much debt. The health insurance companies offer such limited coverage and almost exclusively to high income neighborhoods. So, if their insuree visited a hospital or clinic or anything outside of their coverage area, the insurance company would refuse to pay the hospitals fees or only agree to paying a small portion. So the medical facility ultimately ends up assuming the debt and this eventually snowballs. Anyways. Vivek began charging these insurance companies high premiums on the accounts he could collect on in an attempt to make up for the losses for patients they wouldn't pay for. This is where they try and paint him as a villain. Long story short. He sold the the hospitals and created Clover Health in order to solve this corrupt problem throughout the health insurance industry. For his time and money invested. He didn't make money as much as he learned from this experience. So a big part of Clover's mission is offering widespread coverage to their insurees. These big insurance companies are hating this. Hence much of the hate for Clover.

&#x200B;

**Part 2: DC Enrollment Numbers (May 2021)**

* CLOV announced their initial Direct Contracting (DC) enrollment numbers in their most recent quarterly report. The 65,000 DC patients were far below the 200,000 that the market was expecting. There was obviously a miscommunication between CLOV and the market. CLOV stated they had *access* to 200,000 Medicare patients through their network of 1,800 providers using their software. Analysts took that as a projection of enrollment. They still have access to all those patients and will enroll them over time. My guess is they were able to do [claims-based alignment](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/direct-contracting-summary) for much of the initial 65,000 DC patients, which is automatic. Now they have to market this program to the other $135,000 DC patients to get them enrolled via [voluntary alignment](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/direct-contracting-summary) (i.e. consent). They could also market the MA plan which has more benefits. That's the power of CLOV having a network of providers contracted with its DCE and MA plan.
* This lower DC patient enrollment has now been priced in with analysts adjusting down to an average price target of [$9.33](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CLOV/research-ratings). These price targets are based on extremely conservative enrollment projections and revenue projections from CLOV for their DC business.
* They set forecasts at 70,000 to 100,000 by end of 2021. *They already have 65,000 enrolled in April*. They intentionally set expectations extremely low to absorb the negative market reaction upfront and then outperform going forward. They also reported extremely low revenue projections for the DC patients. They're only projecting [$20M - $30M](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-health-reports-first-quarter-2021-financial-results) for the year.
* I would guess that their **profits** from the DC market this year could be $25M+ (5% margin x 65,000 patients x $850 x 9 months). Revenue should be similar to Medicare Advantage at $850+ per patient per month. That's at least $55M in Medicare payments per month for 65,000 DC patients.
* They did state that ""[GAAP revenue estimates for Direct Contracting are dependent on the finalization of accounting treatment, which we expect will be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2021](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-health-reports-first-quarter-2021-financial-results)"".

**Part 3: Differentiation**

* CLOV does have a virtuous cycle built into its business. It's all based on their relationship with their provider network. When they contract with a healthcare provider, they give them access to the Clover Assistant (CA) for free. CA is a software platform that analyzes electronic health record (EHR) and claims data to provide decision support back to the provider at the point of care.
* The CA platform is a population health tool. There are competing software solutions in the market. The difference here is that the provider has to pay for access to those tools. CLOV pays the provider to use the CA platform. CLOV pays **$200** per visit, which is much higher than the average [$121.45](https://truecostofhealthcare.org/medicare_part_b/) that other MA plans pay.
* The reason that CLOV pays the provider to use it is because it improves the top and bottom line for CLOV. CA helps providers make better treatment decisions and document risk scores more accurately, which results in higher Medicare payments (to CLOV and the provider). Higher Medicare payments directly increases the top line revenue. Better treatment decisions lead to lower costs, which allows CLOV (MA plan or DCE) to keep more Medicare dollars. If you're interested in how CA works, I'll include some bulletpoints at the bottom of the post.
* **Happy providers are key to increasing the number of lives managed long term.** Providers are directly involved in the ""alignment"" process for DC enrollment, and their opinion is highly respected when making a recommendation around which MA plan a patient should choose. As CLOV grows its provider network, it will increase enrollment for both MA and DC. It will also lead to more CA software users, more software users usually leads to better experience and insights, which could reinforce itself and bring more providers onboard.

# Risks to CLOV

Below are the biggest risks I see for CLOV, in order of importance:

**1.** **DOJ Investigation**

As I mentioned above, I don't think there were illegal practices going on at CLOV that management, Chamath, or the third-party counsel were aware of. It's still possible the DOJ investigation finds something. This happens all the time in the Medicare industry, including to the biggest names ([UnitedHealth, Humana,](https://www.whistleblowerattorneys.com/blog/whistleblower-unitedhealth-medicare-advantage-fraud) [Cigna](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/doj-cigna-medicare-advantage-fraud-lawsuit/583023/), etc.).

All the MA plans learn from each other's missteps. CLOV has been operating an MA plan for over 5 years now. They were [fined $106,095 in 2016](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payer/cms-fines-clover-health-for-misleading-marketing-tactics) for 'misleading' marketing tactics. *They haven't been fined since*. They have also gone through multiple rounds of funding from top venture capitalists and Google. There's been no shortage of due diligence on this company.

Yet, there is always the risk that someone somewhere was doing something illegal this time. If that is the case, it will likely end up in a lawsuit. I've seen many cases get to this stage and then get dismissed by a federal judge ([UnitedHealth 1](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/antifraud/unitedhealthcare-medicare-advantage-fraud-suit-department-justice), [UnitedHealth 2](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payer/department-justice-unitedhealth-medicare-advantage-fraud), ). Worst case scenario for the company, there is a settlement. Here are examples of MA plans paying settlements for ""upcoding"" fraud cases:

* UnitedHealth (2017): [$32M](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/antifraud/florida-insurers-pay-32m-to-settle-medicare-advantage-fraud-case)
* Kaiser Permanente (2020): [$6.3M](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/medicare-advantage-provider-pay-63-million-settle-false-claims-act-allegations)
* Humana (2021): [$12.5M](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/payer-issues/humana-roche-settle-false-claims-lawsuit-for-12-5m.html)

The largest settlement ever was [$270M](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/medicare-advantage-provider-pay-270-million-settle-false-claims-act-liabilities) by HealthCare Partners (now part of UnitedHealth) in 2018. This was because the providers themselves were submitting false codes (not the health plan). All of these settlements are for ""upcoding"". Again, among all the accusations, I would be most surprised if CLOV was actually doing this. If anything, the Clover Assistant should result in better documentation around the codes because that's what it's designed to do.

No matter how cynical a view you want to take on the DOJ investigation, CLOV has no debt and $700M in cash from the SPAC proceeds, so a settlement should not significantly impact them.

**2.** **SEC Investigation**

The SEC investigation was announced the day after the Hindenburg report came out. The SEC is investigating whether the DOJ inquiries were material enough to require disclosure to the market. The investigation may not be closed until the DOJ inquiries have been resolved. If the SEC determines there should have been a disclosure, there will likely be a fine. I'm not an expert on SEC enforcement. The only thing I could point to would be the $20M fine Elon Musk paid for announcing a fake acquisition at a much higher price at the time. He picked $420 as the fake number, not sure why...

**3. Market Multiple**

Valuations based on profitability could be hurt in the short term. Medical costs are higher this year due to delayed care during COVID-19, so all companies in this space will have compressed margins in the short-term. I believe growth is more important than profitability in this market when you're looking at <1% of DC patients enrolled. CLOV has proven to be exceptional at growth and has proven it both in MA and now DC.

There could also be a general downturn in market sentiment, and these growth stocks with low margins would be affected the most. However, Medicare is a very stable business and these companies will continue to grow independent of economic conditions.

# Current Technical Analysis (unbiased)

There are several **bullish indicators**, however we must not discard the **bearish signals** that may bring about a short term reversal for CLOV. If a reversal does occur, at least we know that we are prepared for it, instead of being taken by surprise. But again, the bullish indicators may very well prevail. We simply **need good volume** to keep pushing.

&#x200B;

[3 Month Chart](https://preview.redd.it/um9bgnnmrp371.png?width=1385&format=png&auto=webp&s=50c28ccc2e414cfe632ec9e02f27a0bed05ab4d1)

On the above chart, we see price action testing and re-testing Fibonacci key levels during the last 3 month period with successes and failures. We are now at a fork where the price may bounce off and reclaim higher levels, or breach thru and re-test lower levels. No one can pretend to know with certainty which direction will tug harder.

&#x200B;

[3 Month Cup and Handle](https://preview.redd.it/vwnw4epnrp371.png?width=1382&format=png&auto=webp&s=380e0274bd5ae0f72d8a8da281d3c3308ee5302a)

Above is the 3-month period where a very clear cup and handle pattern has formed. This is [normally a bullish signal.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cupandhandle.asp)

&#x200B;

[1 Month Cup & Handle](https://preview.redd.it/68sgv5qorp371.png?width=1384&format=png&auto=webp&s=13c1cde47d3f4bba53a404545aac466d8a29d372)

Above is the same cup and handle pattern, but on the 1-month chart.

&#x200B;

[15 day chart - 11$ target](https://preview.redd.it/bypsajpprp371.png?width=1381&format=png&auto=webp&s=c79ee05682fc83d1b1109146325945b50fb13f10)

On the 15-day chart, an uptrend was formed with higher highs and higher lows. Price kept bouncing off the trend line to finally break out and trade sideways for several days. Another breakout occurred and we are now at the fork. A triangle pattern can be displayed, but it is unclear whether it is a bullish or a bearish pattern. Depending on how you wish to look at it, the price can break thru in any direction. Add to that the Fibonacci levels, and we have ourselves a Mexican standoff.

&#x200B;

[5 day chart](https://preview.redd.it/zi0ltovqrp371.png?width=1383&format=png&auto=webp&s=b326b85e59765f7623714391c9cd2936a577c189)

Finally, on the 5-day chart, if the price fails to bounce off both the 61.8% and 50% Fibonacci price zones, then we may enter a new downtrend.

&#x200B;

* **In the end, volume and catalysts may keep the bullish trend alive much longer, even if minor pullbacks occur.**  
* **We need to Hold 9$ this week in order to break through $10.50**
* **Short sellers are underwater at 11$ so they are trying hard to prevent this**
* **epic squeeze could happen if we break 11$**
* **Do the shorts really not think insiders would like to see 30$ before they can sell anything?  Apparently the CEO is never getting paid for any of this lol.**

# The Meme-Stock Correlation, Short Interest, and Gamma Squeeze setup

To keep this short and sweet - CLOV was originally identified by WSB & Stocktwitters for the short interest being reported over 100% at one point.  This is due to several miscalculations but the idea is true that SI is not being correctly reported.  It is estimated to be over 50% but is reported around 40% on Ortex.  This has been the main area of interest in relation to meme stocks.

# How did CLOV get caught up in all the meme madness?  

Well..  if you dont remember, back in January, chamath palihapitiya encouraged retail investors, along with elon musk, to buy and SQUEEZE GME + AMC.  

[GME squeezes from 60 to over 150 the next day on this Tweet](https://preview.redd.it/quoosh9nup371.png?width=1176&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a0b3d8969d37920eee6947d97ac8585eaea345d)

[but this helped too](https://preview.redd.it/qucv5j9tup371.png?width=1182&format=png&auto=webp&s=88e306406085ab9fc59d787bd3ab2381a52df689)

He made himself an enemy of hedgefunds who lost on these bets.  So when they doubled down their shorts on gme / amc - they went after chammaths stock, CLOV.  But they fucked up.  They doubled down and shorted it to shit because they lost money because of him.  

With great fundamentals, **the short thesis is based on one thing alone - the HindenTurd report -** and guess what that is?  bullshit.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Did you mention Gamma Squeeze??

yes I did.   I even googled it for you apes.

[so basically, the amount of OPEN INTEREST on each STRIKE in the CALL OPTIONS CHAIN tells us how many shares market makers need to buy in order to hedge when an option goes IN THE MONEY.](https://preview.redd.it/9xwx5eusvp371.png?width=922&format=png&auto=webp&s=a249f7e92d29af0518dddff6cb7079788f1c88c8)

So basically, look at the **open interest** on each Strike.  Each new strike that goes in the money has to get hedged.  So basically multiply the open interest x 100 for each strike. 

&#x200B;

[if we can get the 10$ strike ITM, it should start a domino effect especially during a month that requires this many shares be bought for the Russell 2000 index.  Imagine if they had to buy in at over 15$...](https://preview.redd.it/is8dlv9ewp371.png?width=1576&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8053c02d47b4b92c351b11b47875a53adb94cd9)

* Is a Gamma Squeeze possible?  
   * Yes.  
* is a Short Squeeze possible?  
   * Yes.
* Will either of the above happen?
   * IDK.  

&#x200B;

* Will CLOV get to 30$ regardless of these 2 things?
   * Yes.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------

# TLDR:

* Clover Health is basically Medicare insurance for old people meets AI tech (the clover assistant for doctors) it’s a huge healthcare disruptor. 
* They have 45+% year over year growth, zero debt, 700 mill in cash, 100%+ institutional ownership.. \*\*\*They basically make money everytime someone gets old & then doctors use their clover assistant to connect data in more efficient ways to save costs and improve outcomes…
* Fair value is 15$ but insiders and CEO can’t sell till 30$ for 90 days. So 30$ IS EXPECTED. and chammath said it’s a 10x in 10 years company.
* Chelsea Clinton is on the board + the former trump head of Medicare, google is invested and a partner. President is ex google engineer Andrew toy. 
* Got Spaccd to the public by Chamath & shorted to oblivion by Hindenburg & short sellers who attacked this one in particular because he encouraged amc / gme .. short interest is likely above 50% and it seems to have a gamma squeeze setup in the options chain.
* The short thesis is based on the Hindenburg report which is based on what can be found inside my asshole.
* It’s a completely legit, solid growth / healthcare / tech & Medicare insurance company.
* \*\*Also a WSB legend [u/SIR\_JACK\_A\_LOT](https://www.reddit.com/u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT/) has 2 million all in on CLOV bitches

# CATALYSTS FOR PRICE ACTION:

* June 25. Russell 2000 index inclusion, will force 70 million in shares purchased for ETF's that track it.
* further discussion of reduced Medicare age or related
* public announcement Clearing of the DOJ / SEC inquiries.. ***this ones HUGE for fucking up the short thesis at its core...***
* future earnings & enrollment #’s, (every time they beat numbers will be great...)
* clover assistant updates
* I’m sure other things like great PR will eventually come out hopefully more from Chamath and the Clinton.

181,ACADEMY & THOR Tues Earnings,"Thoughts on the earnings call on Tuesday for Tho and ASO. After launching it's IPO in October ASO has been on a tear and it's competitor Dicks trades at 80+ a share. I really believe ASO is WAAAAY WAAAAAAAAAAAAY undervalued. I live in Texas where Academy is the ""Go to"" for sporting goods and having watched the lines of 100+ people at 7am waiting for ammunition outside I believe it's going to have a big move on Tuesday after beating earnings. 

Thor- They are the Ford+GM+FCA combined of the RV world. They make over a dozen different brands and are represented all over the place. The shortage of supplied and material in 2020 seems to be overcome as units are back on the lots now and demand has never been higher. 

I think both of these are set to move this week with both of them substantially beating their earnings. 

And ASO being a long term play that's got a lot of value to it over the next 2 years. I see it trading at the level of Dicks after a year of crushing earnings calls.

# Preamble

Earlier this year, you probably heard about the insane cold snap that hit Texas. This was the harshest cold snap that has occurred in the past 30 years. During this cold snap, Energy prices soared as Texas residents turned up the heat in their homes. Due to this unexpected need for energy and a breach of contract by natural gas providers, every major energy provider in the area struggled to keep up with demand. Customers found themselves with mountainous electricity bills, however those who were provided energy by TXU(subsidiary of VST) were assured that they would be “insulated” from the incredibly high energy costs. TXU covered the costs and took a major financial hit. This led to many investors riding the small brain slide down to a share price of $17 near the end of February.

https://preview.redd.it/cefgrmkmjy371.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f95e79ac6b85fb806f2d91c8109cefe3a0351af5

# Insider Buying

In early March, insiders reacted to the dip by purchasing more shares of VST. James A Burke, the president and CFO of the company, purchased 30,000 shares. Being the CFO James is very aware that VST is not likely to go bankrupt and has very good future prospects. In early May, on another VST price drop, James A Burke purchased 50,000 more shares. The CFO of VST is betting nearly $1.3m dollars that the share price will return to the $20s. On May 6th, CEO Curtis A Morgan, bought 61,730 shares of VST. It’s clear that insiders know this stock was hit far too hard on the bad news in February.

# Huge Expansion in Texas Market

Before the pandemic, Texas was being flooded with young entrepreneurial minded millennials who were tired of paying the insane rent prices of CA and NY. During the pandemic, this Texan renaissance was accelerated due to younger people and larger corporations fighting back against COVID restrictions(Elon Musk’s move to Austin is a prime example). This huge expansion in the Texas market was already starting to show in 2019 when VST hit nearly $12b in revenue and the stock hit an all time high of \~$27. With the good press TXU received by absorbing the costs of energy during the crisis, their image amongst these newcomers is great.

# Short squeeze potential

This company is not a meme and has very low short float. There will be no squeeze, the big brain balloon will carry VST to the top of the atmosphere at a steady pace but it will not enter orbit. 

# Bear Case

While Vistra is one of the leading energy providers in Texas, and will continue to be in the near future, Vistra is not pivoting to clean energy as quickly as it could be. With political forces pushing towards net 0 emissions, Vistra could find itself in hot water. The company currently has a plan to push for 18% of it’s energy to become renewable by 2030 but as of 2020 only 0.3% of the energy produced by Vistra is renewable. With 9% of their total energy produced by uranium, \~9.3% of energy produced by Vistra in 2020 was “clean” energy.

# Fundamental graph analysis

A strong fundamental analysis of VST stock clearly shows the big brain balloon bringing to stock back up to $24. Those who sold after the small brain slide are funding the big brain balloon passenger tickets.

https://preview.redd.it/9fr40azojy371.png?width=586&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc25d98c4d611ccd89befddb6bfa178db7ea6a01

# TLDR

It was cold in Texas. Vistra took a financial hit because energy costs rose but it kept the price low for customers. The market reacted with a huge sell off. Insider bought lots of shares after the sell off. Insiders are riding the big brain balloon to the top of the atmosphere when Vistra recovers.

# Position

I own 500 shares of Vistra @ 16.43. It makes up 1/4th of my risk portfolio.

191,You are the product,"The surge of trading in offbeat stocks is duping inexperienced investors in to high costs and a battle with Wall Street that they cannot win, according to the founder of one of the largest trading firms in the world.

Zero-commission trading helps to build an illusion that amateur investors have never had it better, Alex Gerko, co-chief executive of London-based XTX Markets, told the Financial Times in an interview.

But the way retail brokerages sell on their customers’ orders and a “very poor benchmark” mean that the smallest investors together shell out billions of dollars in hidden costs every year when buying or selling US equities, he explained.


“The GameStop episode made it obvious that the retail part of the market is particularly broken,” Gerko said, referring to the huge spike in the console store chain’s shares in January. “The incentives are there to create a lot of churn in very illiquid stocks, which is exactly what we are seeing this year.”

On the face of it, the GameStop frenzy was an unprecedented victory of young amateur traders over Wall Street professionals including some hedge funds that had been betting against the company. But Gerko thinks the reality is the opposite. “If you think of zero commissions, on paper it sounds great — trading was expensive and now it’s free. That’s obviously complete nonsense,” he said.

Part of the allure of retail platforms such as Robinhood is that they provide zero-commission trading. But Gerko said charges are hidden in the difference between the buy and sell price, the so-called spread, meaning brokers and market makers want clients to trade shares where this gap is widest, such as in illiquid stocks that are generally thinly traded.

“If a market maker earns a certain spread from retail flow, and then pays some percentage of that spread to the retail broker . . . you end up with a perverse incentive to ensure that the end clients trade stocks with very wide spreads,” he said.

The 41-year-old mathematician’s criticism comes as shares in cinema chain AMC Entertainment and other meme stocks, popular with retail investors in online forums such as Reddit, are soaring once again. AMC shares have jumped by more than 500 per cent in the past month to last week’s highs before moderating, gaining a further boost after the company promised retail investors additional perks — including free popcorn.


Gerko said brokerages and other intermediaries are among the beneficiaries of these share price pops, particularly as retail brokers often sell their clients’ trades in bulk on to market makers, which then aim to secure favourable prices for clients. This practice, known as “payment for order flow” (PFOF), earned US brokers $2.9bn in 2020 without charging amateur investors commission up front, and has attracted attention from regulators.

“In the current ecosystem there is somehow enough . . . [to] leave market makers with billions of dollars of revenue,” he said. “So where does this money come from? The retail investors. When people are claiming that they provided X billion dollars of price improvement last year, the question is whether any of that price improvement is real. And whether it’s something they should be proud of.”

The Russian-born UK citizen started his career as a currencies trader at Deutsche Bank. In 2015, he set up XTX Markets and built one of the largest computer-driven trading firms in the world. He has kept a low profile while amassing more wealth than some household names. Last year he contributed more to the UK’s tax coffers than the Duke of Westminster, according to the Sunday Times, making him the 13th largest individual taxpayer in the country.

His firm does not employ human traders but relies purely on computer models to buy and sell assets in a bid to generate profits. It does not engage in payment for order flow. The firm is the third largest dealer in global currency markets and handles 13 per cent of European equities traded on exchanges. Since 2019, the company has also been in US stock markets.

A recent paper from consultancy BestX Research said price improvement on retail market orders averages about 25 per cent, compared with the standard benchmark. But the paper added that this in reality was “akin to getting a 30 per cent discount on an item after the shopkeeper raises the price by 40 per cent,” because the benchmark covers only a small slice of the market.

Broker Robinhood and the two of the largest US market makers, Citadel and Virtu, have defended the PFOF model, arguing there is no evidence that payment for order flow harms investors. But newly sworn-in chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, has said he would make the PFOF model a focus of future work.

Gerko said one solution could be to strip PFOF out of the process, and instead to feed retail traders’ orders on to exchanges where they would match off against each other or market makers would compete to execute the deals. He also bats away criticism that his proposals are self-serving, noting that XTX advocates for market structure changes in all markets, even where they play a dominant role already, such as currency markets.

Even with those kinds of changes, however, he doubts that retail investors can emerge victorious from another round of battle with sophisticated trading firms. “Retail investors have managed to cause some pain to one hedge fund. I can assure you in the long run it won’t be retail participants winning this game, that’s just impossible.”

192,CHWY Short Squeeze and ER play candidate 6/10,"Chewy (founded by Ryan Cohen) is the largest pure-play online pet retailer in the US, with 19M+ active customers & 60k+ products from 2k+ brands. We believe pet is a growing and highly attractive category that is early in the shift online (\~30% penetration in 2020), and in our view Chewy is well positioned as the leader in online pet with a \~50% market share. We believe Chewy has multiple top-line drivers that support sustained 20%+ growth (+17% secular growth, Pharmacy, services, & international expansion), with profitability pulled-forward and sustainable as some of the company’s fastest growth areas are also its highest margin (i.e. private label, Pharmacy). Importantly, CHWY’s Autoship subscription program customers account for over 2/3rds of net sales, which we believe serves as a key competitive advantage that drives strong revenue visibility & differentiated unit economics.

&#x200B;

**Chewy’s 2020 revenue surged 47% to $7.15 billion to beat FY19’s 37% sales expansion. Plus, it reported its first quarterly profit in Q4, crushing our bottom-line estimates by 222% to extend its streak of impressive beats to three-straight quarters.**

&#x200B;

**4QFY Results (ending 1/31):**

Strong Qtr with Top-line Growth Accelerating & Significant Profit Upside. Net Sales of $2.04B (+51% Y/Y) came in well above the high-end of mgmt's $1.94B-$1.96B guide (+43-45% Y/Y) & buyside client expectations of \~$2B (\~48% Y/Y) based on our conversations. Growth was driven by Active Customers of 19.2M (+43% Y/Y, +8% Q/Q) & Net Sales per Active Customer of $372 (+3% Y/Y). We believe upside was driven by: 1)CHWY benefitting from its investment in inventory earlier in the year, which helped avoid supply chain challenges & meet elevated demand; 2) continued strong trends w/in CHWY’s ‘COVID-cohort,’ with CHWY capturing 12% more initial share of wallet from its FY20 cohort vs. prior years; & 3) accelerated traction in CHWY’s higher-growth hardgoods, healthcare, & proprietary brands.  CHWY noted only 35% of customers are exposed to proprietary brands today & its healthcare offering is utilized by <20% of customers—plenty of runway ahead. Gross Margin of 27.1% represented CHWY’s best GM in history & increased \~300bps Y/Y. Half of the leverage was due to growth in higher-margin verticals (hardgoods, proprietary brands, & healthcare) and the other half due to a favorable pricing & promotional environment. EBITDA of $61M (3.0% margin) was well ahead of our/consensus $4M/$0M estimates, though did include a $16M benefit from the release of a non-income tax reserve.

&#x200B;

**FY21 Outlook:**

CHWY guided to FY21 Net Sales of $8.85B-$8.95B (+24-25%Y/Y), above our prior $8.8B estimate & buyside client expectations of $8.7B-$8.8B based on our conversations. CHWY noted most of the positive momentum in FY20 has carried over into FY21, with QTD customer acquisition & spending trends remaining strong. Mgmt does expect some inventory challenges in the wet food category, an industrywide issue that is likely to persist until summer. However, CHWY should be better positioned than competitors given its ability to prioritize inventory for its Autoship customers.  Turning to profit, CHWY guided to FY21 EBITDA margin expansion of +50-100bps Y/Y, or 1.7%-2.2% margin. This is above consensus 1.9%/1.8% margin estimates at the high-end, & comes despite CHWY investing \~$60M in higher wages & benefits largely for its fulfillment & customer service teams.

&#x200B;

AND it's shorted to hell.

ALL IN CHWY ROCKETS

194,Analysts are bullish on Viasat (VSAT). It's doomed.,"Disclaimer: This is not financial advice.  I simply see an opportunity for me to make money from an upcoming conflict between competitors that I'm already confident has been lost before it really begins.  I thought i'd share.

**Viasat** is a company that provides satellite broadband connectivity in the form of residential services, airliner connectivity, and government (primarily military).

They're 1.6B in debt, and they make about $7M net per quarter.  To quote their [recent earnings report](https://investors.viasat.com/static-files/393791ed-ba16-4116-a556-cebf19ae5eb1):

""Although we expect continued revenue growth, margins likely will be somewhat pressured by new market entry costs and, later in the fiscal year, infrastructure expenses associated with the ViaSat-3 (Americas) launch.""

So their already razor thin (well below the industry standard) margins are going to decrease.  They are launching 3 new satellites as part of their ViaSat-3 constellation.  They seem to expect to make this up via the increased bandwidth and subscribers they'll get with these new satellites.

2021Q4 Revenue was broken down thusly: 

**Government Services: $280.8M**

**Residential Services: $230.3M**

**Commercial Networks: $84.7M**

Again, net income was $7M net.  Razor thin margins (they expect to get thinner) for a company with so much debt.

All that said, they're doing an admirable job with what resources they have.  **What you won't find mentioned in their earnings report is exactly what's going to crush their already modest net revenue: SpaceX's Starlink.**

First, lets compare their residential broadband services:

https://preview.redd.it/mfzdjpcxsw371.png?width=259&format=png&auto=webp&s=d697e367ec03c33f3fb2c72210f3020adafcae32

Note 1: Data retrieved from Viasat's website via a quote for (its premium) service in a rural area.

  
Note 2: Although high speed is capped on Viasat, it is throttled after the 150GB (200GB in some areas), so subscribers won't be entirely cut off after exceeding the cap.

Note 3: The Starlink info was from averages of real-world testing with a speedtest taken every 3 hours for 26 days.

As you can see.....  there's really no comparison.  Starlink is currently on a limited beta, which is expected to end sometime in Summer 2021.  I expect many of its customers are already switching to Starlink despite its beta status, but that exodus of residential subscribers will likely turn into a tsunami by the end of 2021.

Next up is why its government revenue is also in danger:  [The Department of Defense is testing it.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/12/spacex-prepares-for-air-force-test-of-starlink-satellite-internet.html)  The duration of the tests is expected to last ""4 to six months"".  That article is from 12 March.  If you do the math, you'll see that the DOD's testing will end at the same time Starlink comes out of beta.  That's a huge double-whammy to Viasat's two biggest revenue sources.

The last revenue source is commercial internet (think airlines' ""in-flight wifi"", commercial shipping connectivity, etc): [That market too, is under attack by SpaceX.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/18/spacex-asks-to-test-starlink-satellite-internet-with-a-gulfstream-jet.html)

So that's it..... that's what they do... they provide satellite broadband.  They're launching 3 new satellites, which will be obsolete before they're even in orbit, that will come with increased operating costs.... which will eat into their razor thin margins.  Additionally, they are relying on increased subscribers to offset those cost at the exact time prospective new and existing subscribers will obviously be signing up for Starlink.  They don't appear able to handle even a moderate loss of residential subscribers.... much less a large one while also losing government and commercial contracts.

195,No AMC or BB holders should be wearing pants and here's the analysis to prove it,"Like all of you, I was fascinated by Adam Aron's bold strategy to not wear pants in a [Zoom interview](https://www.crossingbroad.com/2021/06/adam-aron-did-not-appear-to-be-wearing-pants-on-this-zoom-call.html) last week. However, I was even more fascinated by the correlation between Aron's refusal to wear pants and the price of AMC. As you can see in my red crayon analysis below, Thursday saw a deep AMC dive, but quickly rebounded after Aron's daring refusal to wear pants during his interview. As a result of Aron's fearless leadership, tendies soared, and it rained diamonds. Of course, paper handed bitches  immediately started denying that Aron was pantsless, causing fear and doubt among the lesser apes, and AMC dropped on Friday.

But all this no pants business got me thinking. What about ***MY*** pants? If Aron's no pants correlation is true for AMC, is it also true for BB? Luckily, I hadn't yet eaten all of my red crayons, allowing me to do another deep dive into BB, which is also posted below. As any true smooth brainer can see, there is an obvious correlation between whether I had pants on and the price of BB. I was WFH on Tuesday and Wednesday, so obviously I refused to wear pants, and BB soared as a result. However, my batshit crazy boss made me come in for a half day on Thursday, and I had to wear pants for some of that day, resulting in pants confusion and a volatile BB market. Friday was terrible, as I had to return to the office for the ENTIRE day, resulting in horrible losses for BB.

The conclusion of my analysis is clear guys. DO NOT WEAR PANTS next week. If your boss won't let you WFH, then quit and go work for your wife's boyfriend.

TL/DR: **DO NOT WEAR PANTS THIS WEEK YOU RETARDS**

196,$AMC and $GME Are Going To Cycle through Dips And Peaks This Year.,"Both stocks are a battleground in the war between retail and institutional investors.  The reason why there will be a lot of money made against short sellers this year is due to what the actual outcome of this battle means.  The battle is who gets to control the narrative in the market.  That's far more valuable than the actual fundamentals in any of these investments.  The value of both these stocks now balances on the fact they are ""battleground stocks.""

AMC and GME were slated to be windfalls for short sellers and predatory investors.  Major Hedge Funds keep taking stupid losses on these stocks because they need to be right.  If they aren't right then the narrative is broken.  So they can't continue a cycle of targeting stocks they want to crash and profiting off the panic they generate.  If retail dictates the narrative then being able to short sell a stock down to nothing becomes a lot harder.  Analysts actually have to study companies intensively and follow market sentiment rather than justifying their sentiment and engineering the falling share price.

So yeah I would hold forever.  Because maybe you FOMO this time around and end up holding the bag.  But we have seen several spikes this year, so next go around you find yourself profiting.  We have seen multiple billion dollar losses reported by hedge funds.  It's easy to suggest that these funds are coming back in to closely watched stocks, trying to short and getting caught.  So we see squeezes and general excitement over serious money being on the wrong side of these stocks.

So not a financial adviser, just a retard.  But yeah I'd hang in, buy during dips and hold until you're happy to profit.  We are going to see AMC and GME fought over all year because the precious narrative is at stake.",196

199,"Another good, clean 🚀🌙 DD... Let's review some discussion and thoughts about our wives' newest bf... Mr. $CLNE","Hello again WSB,

Are you enjoying a weekend of recovery from an unfortunate (read: 100% normal) week of buying high and selling low? WELL, same here. Now that I'm awake from that Friday night bender (it's Sunday?), I wanted to take a few minutes to do a couple of things....

1. TL;DR at the bottom, but I do hope you take a second to skim it
2. Review some analyst predictions and price targets on CLNE
3. Talk to you about CLNE short activity that has taken place over the last couple of days
4. Update the room on the status of market conditions surrounding CLNE and just some sentiment

If you want to learn more about CLNE, I've got a short DD post in my history from last week that you can check out; it's an easy read. Or, recommended, you can search for one of the more in depth DD's done here; all great work.

^(Disclaimers:) 

^(1. no images because auto-mod kept screwing me last time.  - 2. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. - 3. 1,000 shares at <$8.25 average dating back to first purchase in 2020.  - 4. Thank you mom for turning my computer on and transcribing my incoherent mumbling into these words.)

# Let's start with a review of analyst price targets... CLNE closed Friday at $9.31

* 5 analysts have offered 12 month price targets on CLNE
* Low estimate is $11.00 (18.2% gain from Friday close)
* High estimate is $27.00 (190% gain from Friday close)
* Median estimate is $20.00 (114.8% gain from Friday close)
* **Cramer came out in May and said he doesn't like the stock**

""aNaLyStS aRe DuMb AnD Ur DuMb ToO"" - I know and I know. ""AnD aMaZoN iS GoNnA dIlUtE tHeM sHaReS bRuThUr!"" What? Ok..... **To quote Bill \[from science videos shown in elementary school class rooms whose last name happens to be the same as a small cap stock ticker\],** ***consider the following...***

* There's a legitimate case to be made for the stock having an extended-term floor of somewhere near $13.49, thanks to details of their partnership with little-known company called Amazon.
* As a part of the deal with Bezos Inc, which also supports 46 CLNE fueling stations, Amazon reserved the right to purchase up to 53 million shares on warrants at a strike price of $13.49.
* *However,* only a quarter of these are exercisable immediately. The rest are only vested after Jeff has made a certain amount of fuel purchases from CLNE. This drastically detracts from the cost of the deal, and the way CLNE runs those sales/revenues will most certainly be pumped back into additional infrastructure investment (see their earnings which are always dead on estimates and near $0.00 EPS)
* In short, Amazon has a huge stake pending in CLNE, but only after significant additional expenditure and investment. AKA..... *PARTNERSHIP*

# Moving on to the topic of... shorts and activity...

I'm not as fluent on this subject as I am some others like technical mumbo jumbo and early 2000's pop-punk/emo music (IT'S NOT A PHASE MOM), but I think you'll appreciate the information here and at least be able to connect the dots as to how this relates to the other popular stonk plays on this sub.

* Over the last 10 trading days, before Thursday/Friday, daily shares sold short sits at about 10% of volume.
* On Thursday this rose to 26.8% on the day - on Friday again to 32% on the day
* So what, 26 or 32% isn't huge, right? Sort of.
* The significance from the rise in ratio of shares sold short vs volume is the **concurrent spike in volume.... In terms of absolute numbers, shares sold short went from about 500,000 per day to 8.10 million on Thursday and 10.64 million on Friday.**
* The major short players on this stock have been Citadel and Blackstone.
* Spoiler alert.... **According to fintel, short shares availability is only 8.6 million as of June 4th.**
* With an average daily volume of around 5 million (again, before Thursday/Friday), how many days to cover....? You do the math.

# And some final thoughts about market conditions around CLNE and the options landscape...

I'm not here to push any squeeze thesis, just providing information to help you develop your own conclusions about what I believe to be a great stock play (I've been in since 2020). There is short and long term potential here, in my opinion.

* The \[now famous\] June 18th $13 strike call OI now sits at 29,544, an increase of about 25% since my last update and representing 2.95 million shares of exercisable calls. This is about 60% of the average daily volume prior to the spike in volume on Thursday/Friday.
* A reddit user, who I won't name because I haven't asked them, who used to work in IR at CLNE indicated to me during chat/discussion this weekend that the leadership team is aware of the recent uptick in interest/sentiment and are excited that people are not only interested in the company, but also believe in the product.
* The DD content and general sentiment on here the last couple of days, and months honestly, has been positive. The environmental side of the story is great. Besides needing a decent business case and technicals, never before in history (my opinion) has it been more important to have a good story/mission to make people feel good about what your company is doing. Our society is more social than ever.
* **🐄💨🚀** 🌙

TL;DR

Do I think this is a one-way ticket to \[the planet\] Uranus? No. Do I think this will make me an overnight millionaire? No, especially because my position is relatively small. But, I do think that there is a legitimate shot at some gains both short and long term here. **The company has a product, sales, partnerships, a good story, and now the backing of an army of passionate people (read: apes) who, quite simply, like the stock.**

Thanks and take care.

203,I built a program that tracks mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter! This week's most discussed and top growing stocks!,"This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. I have also added the Week-on-Week stock price change due to popular requests. 

Overall, it has been an amazing week for investors in general and all the top growing stocks that [I shared here last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/noc6r0/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) have ended in green with an average return of 11.7%. So, without further ado, let's dive into this week’s list! 

 **Most Discussed Stocks of the Week** 

https://preview.redd.it/per8x892fn371.png?width=1039&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d457b0954852cb8d3abacf10341d7dadd99e3d3

Both AMC and BB individually generated more discussion than the other 8 put together! This can be attributed to the possibility of the next squeeze and also the rallying stock price. Weed stocks also made a double entry into the top 10 list with SNDL coming in 4th and TLRY 5th (we will discuss why in the next section). Investors were most bullish about Tilray and Nokia’s prospects as reflected by the sentiment! Another interesting observation is that it has been a rough week for Tesla with it being the only stock in the list that ended in the red.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/ov3zes4cfn371.png?width=1208&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca5d580ccfea58c5659a40b50afec8b78da53666

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. Almost all the stocks increased in chatter due to the rally of meme stocks and not due to any fundamental news

**BlackBerry($BB):** No points for guessing the top growing stock of the week. BlackBerry was also present in the [last week’s list](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/noc6r0/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) and the stock has been running up almost 80% in the last six weeks. The discussions were predominantly driven around whether BB would be the next short squeeze play. Even though the company has made some significant strides over the last year (Collaboration with AWS being an example), there are no specific news that’s driving the current rally.

**Clean Energy Fuels($CLNE):** There isn’t any new fundamental news out of the company for the current rally but the discussion exploded in Reddit and the stock gained as much as 20% on Thursday. The stock experienced a quadrupling of the average daily volume as Reddit investors piled on to the stock. The company is still trading at a healthy 17.6% increase over last week’s closing price.

**Workhorse Group($WKHS):** Even though the company did not have a good month in May with them disappointing the investors with their first-quarter results (the company only delivered six electric cargo trucks). But the shares of the company have rocketed more than 40% in June. The discussion volume as well as the trading volume has been on a consistent rise over the past week.  

**Nokia($NOK):** Nokia’s current rally is primarily driven by optimism over its back-to-back 5G network deployment wins with multiple telecom operators such as Net4Mobility, DITO Telecommunity Corporation, T-Mobile, and Optus. The company has also resolved a long-drawn patent licensing dispute with Daimler and has been strengthening its financials by generating strong cash flows. Investor sentiment has also been extremely bullish as we can see from the trends.

**Sundial Growers($SNDL):** Weed stocks are mainly moving due to a mix of fundamental news and retail trading interest. SNDL rose almost 30% this week before dropping down. The marijuana industry is consolidating and a spate of deals were announced this week. Adding to this, there has been progress in legalization efforts in the US. Tilray(TLRY) has also been on the run with the stock price increasing 12% and the chatter growing by 300% this week.

**Honorable Mentions:** AMC Entertainment($AMC) chatter grew by 189% (which is massive considering that the stock was already the [most discussed stock last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/noc6r0/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/)) and Clover Health ($CLOV) discussions increased by 255% but were not high enough to make the top 5 list.

205,Is GMG a potential long-term gold mine?,"A science podcast I am listening to mentioned a potentially game changing improvement in battery technology that have just been made. A thorough explanation by the podcast host, Dr. Novella, can be found here:

https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/graphene-aluminum-ion-batteries/

**TL;DR**:

GMG has already started production of the batteries that can store 3x the energy and charge 20-70x faster than traditional lithium-ion. They claim they will be able to produce batteries for cars within 2024. 

If this turns out to be true, it can be a real game changer for electric cars the renewable energy industry in general. A potential long-term gold mine? What do you guys think?",205
206,Let's get ready for Moo-nday!,"Let's review why cow farts are the smartest short and long term play on the market ahead of Moo-nday (bullet points for busy apes) :

* Recycled natural gas (RNG) is the future of green commercial long distance transportation and is years ahead of it's competitors in terms of technology and infrastructure (hydrogen/electric). RNG allows for negative emissions and is extremely cost effective.
* Clean Energy ($CLNE) is an established RNG provider with little to no competition. They own most of the infrastructure and the only reason they're not reporting profits quarter after quarter is because they're just building more, prioritizing growth over short term profits.
* $CLNE just secured massive deals with Amazon (heard of them?) and Chevron, paving the way for universal industry adoption.
* The fact that the technology is so misunderstood by Wallstreet has created a tremendous opportunity for early investors.
* PRICE : Even with some of you readers realizing the stock's potential last week, the current price (9.59$ AH) is sitting at a HUGE discount from it's intrinsic value as well as from Amazon's optional buy-in price of 13$. A large number of analysts have openly supported this by setting EOY targets ranging from 11$ (extremely conservative) to 27$ (3x).
* Why does this matter? This means your potential downside of buying at 9.59$ is AT WORST the 15% gained from it's established support at 7.5$ while your potential upside is SIGNIFICANT. As a shareholder, I personally do not see a reason to sell this stock even if the short term scenario (detailed below) plays out because there are few other growth stocks which match it's mid-term potential. Compare this with the possible downside of other meme stocks before making a decision.
* POTENTIAL SHORT TERM PLAY : So if you've read my previous DD as well as the DDs of fellow cow fart enthusiasts, the open interest on the June 18th 13c is a whopping 29,000 with significant open interest on the strikes before and after up to the 20c. As the price approaches 13$, the option sellers who have sold their calls naked are forced to buy shares, driving the price higher. In return, considering the stock has been heavily shorted by Citadel, Blackstone and the like in the past few weeks, this puts short sellers in a precarious situation, especially as we go above 11$. All this, combined with a low market cap (small purchase = big effect), leads to an explosive cocktail. The potential for a gamma and subsequent short squeeze is only the cherry on top for one the best growth stocks in green energy.

So in the end, we have a stock with :

1. Extremely limited downside, significant upside (buy low, sell high)
2. Long and short term gain potential
3. Unparalleled potential for growth
4. Little to no competition in it's field
5. Established partnerships with some of the biggest enterprises in the US
6. And for those of you like me who care for the environment, brownie points for saving the planet in an innovative and cost efficient way (getting rich while preserving nature? yes please!)

Need I say more? This stock will make you feel like Warren Buffet, a silverback ape and Captain Planet at the same fucking time.

208,Taking Some Profit,"Nobody likes to hear this.  The old people don't like this because they live in a fantasy world and have an agenda.

The young people don't like this because they like fireworks and adrenaline.

This is investment advice, by the way.  You should do it.

&#x200B;

This is called trading the Dow/Gold Ratio.  I took the example from this article and made it a little easier to understand.  [https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-news/dow-gold-122020181](https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-news/dow-gold-122020181)

The jist of it is that in 1918, a man has 10 ounces of gold.  For this example below, we want to look at real purchasing power, not inflation , so while 10 ounces of gold would have cost $200 in 1918, we are going to say it cost him $20,000.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------ ONLY HOLDING GOLD ---------------------------

&#x200B;

If he had held the 10 ounces of gold from 1918 until today, our original 10 ounces of gold would now be worth $20,000.  There is no gain from only holding gold.  In this scenario it is a shiny rock.  (we know that if he held cash, he would have LOST $19,800 purchasing power)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\---------------------------------------- ONLY TRADING THE STOCKS ---------------------------------

&#x200B;

By comparison, an equal and simple $20,000 ""buy-and-hold"" investment indexed to the Dow from 1918 to 2018, with dividend reinvested, would have yielded an annual return of 10.44%  The gain on this trade would have been $4.26 million.  The total return was 21,200%

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\----------------------------------------TRADING THE DOW GOLD RATIO ------------------------

&#x200B;

Using $20,000 and trading the Dow/Gold ratio, we end up with $8.4 million a century later. That's a 41,000% return, or double the above investment.  (a forty one thousand percent return of real purchasing power)  I know some of you might be able to throw 100k at this - it seems like a pretty easy way to make 40 million.  Or just use 20k of your 100k to get to 8 million.  Is this BAD advice?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8m4nky8nvr371.png?width=560&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a694e1ab6a10b8b619e065ee58f3156f5fa15af

&#x200B;

As we saw in the first example, just holding the shiny rock didn’t provide any return, it only protected against inflation.

&#x200B;

HOWEVER, if gold or silver were merely inflation hedges, they would actually follow inflation, right?  They would follow the money supply or any other stable number.  You wouldn't have these wild swings.

https://preview.redd.it/6hnk6iyvvr371.jpg?width=1828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d6b52920640c943cbd3ac04663f8353b53f781f7

&#x200B;

Another way to look at this is ff you bought gold in 1980 for $800 an ounce, and then sold it in 2000 for $300 an ounce, you would have actually LOST money.  During this time the CPI and cost of everything didn’t go down, it went up.  So gold should have risen.  It would NOT have performed as an inflation hedge.

&#x200B;

This tells us that if we buy at the wrong time, we lose money.  However, if we buy at the RIGHT time, we have huge gains.  And when we combine that with buying stocks when they are cheap (not right now, although the Dow could hit 40,000 in a melt UP) we get massive gains.

&#x200B;

41,000% of REAL purchasing power gains.  Again, this is not inflation adjusted, if so it would have been a 4 million percent return.

&#x200B;

If you buy gold at the right time, you actually do gain purchasing power, and more importantly, you don’t lose during most stock market corrections.  Then you buy the cheap stocks and hold them while they go up.

&#x200B;

Even if you are not on board with this, think about making 10% of your portfolio gold, silver, or computer money, whatever you think is stable and won't lose.  For gold, you only have to look at what every central bank is doing. (except Canada, lol)  Use the amazing power of the internet to see what China and Russia are doing with gold right now.

&#x200B;

For silver – well – you literally have silver in your hand right now.  It’s used in electronics and solar panels.  70% of silver is used by industry, so it’s definitely not just a shiny rock.  It’s actually a critical metal that will be in short supply for the rest of our lives.  In 2100, there will actually not be any more silver in the ground to mine.

&#x200B;

I don’t know about computer money.  I am not big on real estate right now…because it’s in a bubble.  I think that if you have 100k and you buy silver, that will increase to 500k!  And then you can sell it for cheap stocks or then buy a house.  Again, look at the above charts.  Silver and gold have massive swings during these bubble pops and stock market corrections. 

&#x200B;

If you bought a house for 100k, I think that bubble will pop and you will lose 80k – you will be underwater on your mortgage because it’s only worth 20k.  When this bubble pops, how many 20k houses could you have bought with the 500k of silver?  Twenty five?

&#x200B;

This would be similar to trading the Dow/Gold ratio.  The silver/real estate ratio.  It really does look like most things are in a bubble.  This might expand before popping, or who knows, it might never pop again.

216,Why BIIB is a double from here,"  

Here is a basic calculation, hopefully simple enough for my fellow retards to understand, that makes me think BIIB is massively undervalued even after today’s rally. I am intentionally being very conservative with my estimates.

Now while it has not been officially stated, I just heard on NPR that the Alzheimer’s regimen will cost $56,000 per year. Whether that is the price or not, I think we can all agree that whatever it is, it is going to be a shit ton of money.

For the purpose of this calculation, I am only going to consider US customers, however, the real TAM is much larger. (Currently there are 6 million cases in the US.)[https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/facts-figures]

\[I took the rest of the statistics from Biogen’s income statement.\]( [https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BIIB/financials/annual/income-statement](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BIIB/financials/annual/income-statement))

For a very simple valuation model, I used p/e multiplier and price/rev multiplier.

Since some of this announcement was probably baked in to the price already, I’ll go back to 12/30/20. The closing price was $243.58.

The EPS in 2020 was $24.80 giving an earnings multiplier of 9.82x.

The revenue per share in 2020 was $12,356 million/161 million shares = 76.74, so the price/rev last year was 243.58/76.74 = 3.17.

As a very conservative estimate, let’s assume just 10% of those with Alzheimer’s take the drug. This alone will increase BIIB’s revenue per share by 600,000 x $56,000 / 161 million shares = 208.70.

Using the revenue multiplier, this implies a fair price of $243.58 + 208.70 x 3.17 = $905 per share!

Now based on earnings, according to their income statement, last years net margin was 32.38%. This drug alone will increase their EPS by 600,000 x $56,000 \* 32.38%/161 million shares = $65.58. Using the earnings multiplier, this implies a fair price of $243.58 + $65.58 x 9.82 = $907 per share.

Now, sure, it is not yet proven to work, but they are authorized to put in on the market for 9 years while they do further research. I am also aware that this revenue won’t last forever. Eventually it will fall off patent and they’re profits will decrease. Account for that as you wish, but it still looks like BIIB is massively undervalued.

For about 12 years Freddie Mac & Fanny Mae have been under a conservatorship. This conservatorship was arguably illegally forced onto the company. Currently the Supreme Court owes a opinion in June that will either free Freddie and Fannie of the conservatorship and able to profit. Or of course it could stay a two dollar stock the way it has been for the last 12 years. If the company is free the pre-conservatorship stock price was about $80 a share back in 2007. I could only imagine what the company could be worth now. Last year both companies profited about $30 billion total. That is a lot of margin. That is a ton of profit for such a small company (total employees). All of this money has been swept into the government and has been paying for Obamacare since it started in 2008. The upside is enormous. Can you imagine investing in a two dollar stock with the upside of 80+ dollars per share? Yes the downside is about two dollars or potentially less if the Supreme Court decides to keep the net worth sweep legal. Do your homework. This could be a life changer. I’m swinging for the fences on this one. This is going to be my home run. This has been going on for about 12 years. We are in the ninth inning of the ball game.

224,Explaining Days-To-Cover for Apes,"This is a new account: I switched from my old account so I could make anonymous comments about Megan Markles feet and not get found out by my wifes bf (hi Chad).

**What Is Days To Cover?**

2021 has brought about lots of gains and losses , new investors, and new language to the game. One of these terms is ""Days-To-Cover"".

Days to cover is related to the short ratio as a measure of short interest in a stock. DTC is calculated by taking the quantity of shares that are currently sold short and dividing that amount by the stock's average daily trading volume. For example, if hedge fund 🌈🐻s have shorted 2 million shares of $TENDIES, and the average volume is 1 million, then days to cover is 2.0.

**So Who Cares? Why Is It So Important?**

DTC can serve as a signal on how bearish or bullish traders are about a company. A high days-to-cover ratio might be a signal that company performance is shit.

It also gives investors an idea of potential future buying pressure. In the event of a rally in the stock, 🌈🐻s have to buy back shares on the open market to close out their positions. Obviously they'll try to buy back the shares for the lowest price possible. But since they have created a higher demand for shares, this will drive up the price. Since the price is higher, they need to close out even more of their positon.... which drives the price higher, and so on.

Also, a high days-to-cover ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze. This information can benefit a trader looking to make a quick profit by buying that company's shares ahead of the anticipated event actually coming to fruition.

TL;DR: high days-to-cover = 🌈🐻s being assholes, more likely for $TENDIES going to the moon

This stock could be your ride or die, and TELL is the kind of partner that will have hot 🍗tendies on the table when you get 🏡 .

🐒Fun Fact: Did you know Liquid Natural Gas is used as Rocket Fuel? Well it is, and that is super neat!!!


 A quick re-cap on 🚀TELL
———————————-
“Tellurian Inc (TELL) is a liquefied natural gas (LNG) development company headquartered in Houston, TX. TELL plans to develop a 27.6 mtpa LNG terminal with five plants near Lake Charles, LA, as well as upstream assets and pipeline infrastructure. The initial stage will likely include 3 plants (16.6 mtpa capacity). The Driftwood project will be financed by equity customers/partners as well as project debt financing. Tellurian will own 28%-42% of Driftwood Holdings and 100% of Tellurian Marketing.""

Tellurian is a market disruptor with their proposed Driftwood Project, which will make them the first end-to-end (well for the production company, pipeline network for transportation, terminal LNG for exporting) exporter with an at-cost LNG acquisition independent of domestic Henry Hub (HH) as they'll be selling primarily on Japanese Korean Marker (JKM) at this time. 
——U/V3capitol

 🤔What is this 🪵Driftwood🪵???

Essentially it is a pipeline, some of you may have heard of the Deals that have been signed recently(I will get back to these later) the Driftwood Pipeline is the vehicle that supplies these deals. The Driftwood Dream has been going since 2016, it would seem we are on the cusp of making that dream a reality. 
This summer we should be seeing some press release on infrastructure build out related to the actual pipeline 🏗 construction 🚧🦺 . Q1 2022 is the projected date for FID and when the pipes might be laid😉

Driftwood has permits, the company(Betchel) to build it, and a team that has done it before. Shovel Ready is the term here

When the construction starts the floodgates will be open and this stock will 🚀🌙. Reference a stock like Cheniere(trading @ 87.35), a company Charif Souki used to work for, so you can get an idea. Speaking of Charif Souki let’s take a peak at the team.

———————————

🌟🌟**All-Star Management**🌟🌟

Tellurian has 2 of 3  pioneer LNG founders that developed the largest Natural Gas companies.

Charif Souki - Chairman - LNG Godfather and Legend, who was the founder of Cheniere Energy in 1996. If they can do it once, they can do it again.

Octávio M.C Simoes - CEO - ""Previously, he was President and CEO of Sempra LNG &amp; Midstream where he was responsible for all LNG and natural gas midstream activities in Sempra’s efforts to develop, build and operate liquefied natural gas (LNG) receipt terminals, liquefaction facilities, natural gas pipelines and storage facilities.""
——————-u/V3capitol

This team can and will get it ✅

 
🐒Fun Fact # 2 : So you don’t think LNG is cool? 

Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is natural gas that has been cooled to a liquid state, at about -260° Fahrenheit( now that is pretty cool❄️if you ask me)for shipping and storage. The volume of natural gas in its liquid state is about 600 times smaller than its volume in its gaseous state. This process makes it possible to transport natural gas to places pipelines do not reach.




The Deals📑💸

Right now TELL💥 has  2 👬of them Vitol and Guvnor, each worth 12 Billion💵 over the next 10 years. So 2.4 Billion per year in revenue with these alone. We can expect to hear a couple more deals announced in the next month. 

These deals are what have people so excited for this stock as of late, and rightly so!

I know what your 🤔 thinking, so what!?!🤷🏽‍♀️ “Without that pipeline they will not get any of that money. “

Well to the skeptics🛸🗿🔦 I would ask this: Why would these companies be signing deals without doing their due dilligence?

🦕🦖Fossil Fuels are so last century! Why would I invest in LNG🌋? I should invest in 🌞solar and 🌪wind and blah blah blah.

Well you are not wrong if your talking about coal and oil⛽️.

Natural Gas is going to stay relevant though. Here are some reasons why:

*$* Developing countries can not afford solar and all the fancy smancy tech energy. They will continue to be buyers for a long time to come. Remember 🚀TELL exports🚢⚓️ LNG, “Global Basis”🌎

*$* Demand continues to increase on a “Global Basis” https://www.forbes.com/sites/judeclemente/2021/06/04/the-worlds-liquefied-natural-gas-market-is-roaring-back/

*$*Carbon capture for this industryis set to play a significant role in how countries view LNG. https://www.worldoil.com/news/2021/5/6/us-lng-players-tout-carbon-capture-in-bid-to-boost-green-image

*$* LNG is being used in 🛳cruise ships and 🚀🛸space ships🛰.  Most restaurants use it to cook as well, if you ate food cooked outside your house there is a strong chance it was cooked with LNG. That is just so neat!

*$* 🍸Warren Buffet🍸 bet 9.7 Billion on the long future of LNG. https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/19/why-warren-buffett-is-betting-on-pipelines-evern-as-climate-fears-rise.html

2021 - March/July = $4-$10 - Deals announced gap-up (3B valuation / 409M shares). $7.34

2021 - September or FID announced = $12 - 5B in capital in (5B valuation / 409M shares) $12.22

2024 = $37 at Stage 1 Project completion (15B in valuation / 409M shares).

2025/2026/Mid-decade will see a peak in Demand/Supply pricing where LNG company's valuations could get frothy.

🐒Fun Fact #3 : LNG from landfill gas.   LNG can also be derived from landfill gas. At a landfill near Livermore, California, landfill gas converted into LNG is being used as fuel to power trash collection vehicles. The plant can produce up to 13,000 gallons of LNG per day from landfill gas, enough fuel for 300 LNG powered collection trucks across 20 California communities. This technology not only turns waste into a renewable energy source, but it also benefits the environment due to the significant reduction in fuel emissions produced by the garbage truck fleet.

226,The Weekly DD - Clover Health (CLOV): Moon or Bust? (Full DD),"**Another healthcare company?**

CLOV is a US health insurance company currently specialized in offering Medicare Advantage plans to elderly Americans. As an elderly American seeking healthcare insurance, one of the very first choices presented is whether to go with the federally run Medicare or the privately provided Medicare Advantage (still federally funded though). The difference is as follows:

* Medicare allows the customer to choose what the plan covers. They have Part A (hospital care), Part B (doctor visits and services), and Part D (prescriptions).
* Medicare Advantage is Part C, a pre-packaged plan which bundles together Parts A, B, and (usually) D. Medicare Advantage includes all services that Medicare has plus some.

Medicare Advantage usually makes the process more streamlined and easier. Depending on the plan, it may even be cheaper than Medicare. However, the drawback is a much narrower physician network that’s usually based around a local geography. Thus, if you travel anywhere else, it will be difficult to find in-network physicians for care.

CLOV attempts to innovate in this space with their software platform, Clover Assistant. This is a platform which synthesizes all the data available to healthcare insurance providers to provide better patient outcomes. They do this through several features:

* Evidence-based Protocol: using a data-driven model, the Clover Assistant can provide physicians clinical recommendations based upon the patient’s unique situation (history of disease, allergies, etc.).
* Early Disease Detection: machine learning models can predict potential diseases even when the patient is asymptomatic. It provides a list of what chronic diseases the patient may be at risk for so that the physician can conduct early screening if necessary.
* Quality Gap Closure: surfaces opportunities for additional services that the patient should perform. The physician can take the visit as an opportunity to perform these services or to recommend these specific services to the patient for later.

By doing this, they hope to achieve better early detection and preventative care within their customers which leads to less emergency room visits, less unplanned procedures and prescriptions, and less heart ache (quite literally). All this equates to less *unplanned* *costs* for CLOV and more revenue from their insurance policies. With Medicare advantage plans, the government provides a certain pot of money for covering customer Medicare benefits with certain incentives built in. If all incentives are met and no additional services are needed, then the insurance provider pockets all the remaining money as profit. That’s why CLOV is so focused on decreasing these unplanned costs (and of course, for the people).

**Healthcare - Lacks in appeal**

Medicare is currently only available to those over 65 (though there are proposed regulations to change this which we’ll review later). This is CLOV’s – and other Medicare Advantage providers’ – target demographic. By 2040, adults in the US over the age of 65 is expected to more than **double**, reaching 80 million. Adults age 85+ is expected to **quadruple.** 

https://preview.redd.it/9afneo9olo371.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce2d3c332eee871f02c6e955a409c6011622d981

&#x200B;

Moreover, Americans are living longer which means that Medicare will need to cover more for a longer period. In 2000, the average American male, upon turning 62, could expect to live 19 years longer. In 2040, it is estimated that they will live 22 years longer. This estimate is even higher for females.

This necessitates an expansion of Medicare and Medicare Advantage providers to support America’s aging population. We can see this rapid growth within the national health expenditure (NHE) data that the government releases. In 2019, NHE grew by 4.6% to $3.8T. By 2028, it is expected to grow to **$6.2T.** The largest expenditure for government spending in 2019 was in private health insurance spending which grew 3.7% to **$1.2T** (31% of total NHE). If current spending ratios hold, the 2028 expected spend on private health insurance will be **$1.92T.**

Beyond that, enrollment in Medicare Advantage plans has been growing at faster rate every year since 2005. In 2020, nearly 40% of all Medicare beneficiaries were on a Medicare Advantage plan.

https://preview.redd.it/t4j169dplo371.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=a44f4e56483385721f4b034c285d513246c51d20

&#x200B;

Currently, this industry is dominated by a small number of players with three firms making up over 50% of all Medicare Advantage plan offerings.

* UnitedHealth Group serves \~6.5M people.
* Humana serves \~4M people.
* BCBS serves \~2.5M people.

https://preview.redd.it/b89k1msqlo371.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=09f05df9cad06d0d473366ad04eb8028470c3942

Furthermore, competition is fierce within this space with premiums on plans slowly declining since 2015.

https://preview.redd.it/fvj0s8cslo371.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=b011e630db50b7008e6f2006b9444e369f69362c

&#x200B;

Medicare Advantage plans has become increasingly popular from standard Medicare plans. This trend is observed in every state in the US. The increasing popularity of Medicare Advantage plans is most pronounced in for-profit plans which now account for 71% of all enrollees in 2021. Market emergent players (venture-backed players) accounted for \~240,000 enrollees (\~1% of the national enrollees) which is the largest amount it has ever accounted for.

https://preview.redd.it/zr2ys39tlo371.png?width=868&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2d6d1654276df35b2cc1759ff4b8c812b2797db

In general, healthcare is growing rapidly to keep pace with US’ aging population. Medicare Advantage specifically is growing even faster as it remains highly competitive compared to Medicare. However, as big players wrestle for market share, premiums decline, and profits become more difficult to capture. It is a lucrative market for share but crowded and highly competitive.

**Small fish, big sea**

CLOV is attempting to carve a piece of this market out for themselves. They are a smaller local provider operating in 8 states: Arizona, Georgia, Mississippi, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas. CLOV is one of the nation’s fastest growing insurers capturing \~50% of the net increase in membership across its established markets over the previous three years.

https://preview.redd.it/r6qdc7kulo371.png?width=1190&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e474994dead07b53f86c73ddd628ea4c96e40b0

&#x200B;

They currently serve more than 57,000 members across 34 counties. However, is this growth scalable? Proponents of CLOV believe they can do this. And certainly CLOV is tripling its footprint, expanding out to 74 new counties. Whether this translates to similar levels of growth within these counties is yet to be seen. While capturing 50% of the growth within a county is impressive, they are operating only with a network of less than 60,000 members.

Remember, UnitedHealth Group serves over 6M members. I can’t conclude one way or another if this growth is scalable, but certainly it will become harder and more competitive to scale as they continue growing.

They’re primary moat is in Clover Assistant. However, AI in healthcare is not a new concept. In fact **95%** of health care executes are looking to hire business and analytics staff with experience developing AI. 59% of these executives expect a positive return on the investments they have *already* made in AI. Whereas the scope of their AI may be different than CLOV’s, it is hard to argue that CLOV will be able to maintain a moat when they have access to the same data and technology as their competitors (and even less of it since they have less than 60,000 members).

Furthermore, Hindenberg Research released a damning short report for CLOV. While many of the points raised were addressed by CLOV, some, I still consider legitimate and should worry all potential investors:

* CLOV did not disclose that its AI, Clover Assistant, is under active investigation by the Department of Justice. This investigation regards 12 issues from kickbacks to predatory marketing practices to undisclosed third-party dealings. While I won’t speculate on the severity of these allegations and the results of this investigation, it is alarming that CLOV was not forthright with its investors in revealing this information.
* CLOV has a large dependency on a broker called Seek Insurance which is 50% owned by CLOV. While it is not uncommon for healthcare insurers to use independent brokerages, it is very misleading for Seek Insurance to claim “unbiased and independent” advice with Medicare plans when they are owned by a Medicare Advantage insurer. CLOV responded saying that Seek Insurance is independently operated, but it is difficult to imagine that CLOV has no sway in them even though they own them.
* CLOV’s CEO, Vivek Garipalli, has a history of predatory price-gouging and all-around immoral business practices. Prior to founding CLOV, he owned CarePoint Health which operated 3 hospitals in New Jersey where he charged the highest emergency room service prices in the entire country. Furthermore, he was at the center of an alleged scheme to siphon $157M from his own business into his personal bank account through exorbitant management services charged by LLC’s under his name to his own company.

**Financials**

CLOV’s financials paint a picture of a rapidly growing company. Their revenues increased from $277M in 2018 to $680M in 2020. While their operating costs also grew, it grew at a significantly lesser rate leading to lower net losses in general. In 2018, CLOV reported net losses of $186M and in 2020, they had reduced this to $93M. Their net income losses, however follows a different trajectory. Due to losses from continued operations, their net income had losses of $200M in 2018, $364M in 2019, and $136M in 2020. While 2020 does represent their lowest losses ever, it is not entirely clear whether this is part of a trend or if it’s a one-off fluke.

Their balance sheet does not paint a pretty picture. With total assets of $270M and liabilities of $430M, it is clear that they must fund their continued operations through equity. Remember, they are losing over $100M per year as well. Thus, it is entirely possible that they will dilute their existing equity in order to fund continued operations.

**So, do I like CLOV?**

The short answer is no. CLOV is a small, but fast-growing insurer valued at $3.7B. While they definitely have impressive AI technology, it is not unique in the industry and will not be a moat for them. Their CEO has been involved in shady dealings in the past and the fact that they cannot be forthright about active investigations into their business is concerning. They are currently burning through cash without a healthy balance sheet to hold them through which means that it is likely they will issue additional equities to stay afloat. 

The industry that they are in is certainly lucrative and if they can get a foothold, they will justify their current valuation. However, for my personal conviction, the cons outweigh the pros and I will be passing on this stock.

**TLDR;**

1. CLOV first gained popularity as a short-squeeze “play” versus being a fundamentally solid company with potential growth.
2. Clover Health’s moat lies in Clover Assistant, which is a data analytics and AI platform used to better diagnose patients, saving CLOV on unplanned costs and increases revenue from their insurance policies. However, AI in healthcare is not a new concept. In fact 95% of health care executes are looking to hire business and analytics staff with experience developing AI.
3. Hindenburg Research released a short-report on the company that enlightens some facts and opinions for a bearish case. It also discloses that Clover Assistant is currently being investigated for predatory marketing practices.
4. Although the company has been having stellar revenue growth, their costs associated with revenue have also increased exponentially. Financially, they don’t have the best liquidity and are spending a lot of cash, which raises concerns for potential share dilution down the road.
5. Lastly, their total addressable market is still quite small. They are operating within a network of less than 60,000 members. Although there is room to grow this market to members of a lower age, you have to remember they are targeting medicare to elderly Americans.",226

UWMC wasn't on the first Russell preliminary list due to issues with the voting shares. (Russell miscalulated). This stock is plagued with Russell inclusion issues. First quarter, everyone thought it wasn't included due to the miscalculation of voting shares but it was because they came out as a SPAC and something regarding the SPAC and being listed that way, they weren't able to be listed in the first quarter. They're supposed to be added to this inclusion and now the voting shares were miscalculated like everyone thought was the reason in the first quarters listings. Now, it is in fact the voting shares which were miscalculated. I've sent an email to investor relations and received the response below that they're appealing it.

232,Cannabis Stocks,"I’m excited for the community and what it’s bringing to my life. I want to contribute and hopefully begin a useful discussion.

Currently Tilray and Sundial are big “meme” stocks. There are many other cannabis companies and some making huge moves with huge profits even through COVID. I’m paying attention to management and the decisions their making with cash flow and how they’re looking to expand.

I’ve got a list of stocks I’m following in the cannabis sector and they are not Tilray or Sundial. I do not believe they have the strong foothold needed for a strong investment. I would also like to support a U.S. based company that has yet to run the distance. Canada is completely legal so the market has been established for a few years now.

If we’re looking for a boom it’s going to be here in the U.S. and I want to support our economy. 

I’d like to get some thought provoking conversation on the matter. Please don’t just regurgitate Tilray and Sundial.

**PROS**

According to Bureau of Labor Statistics, the healthcare sector is the largest and fastest growing job segment in the US, employing over 20 million professionals in 2020. Total US employment between 2019 and 2029 is expected to grow by 15% for all healthcare professionals vs. 4% for all occupations. Men on average represented 25% of the US healthcare workforce in 2019, while men’s business represented only 17% of net revenues of 2020. In 2020, the total addressable market of the health apparel industry was an estimated $12B in the US and $79B globally, according to a Frost and Sullivan Study that FIGS commissioned. The same study says the total addressable market in the US is expected to grow by a 6.1% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) over the next 5 years from $12B in 2020 to approximately $16B in 2025.

FIGS sells 98% of their products through their digital platform, and leverages social media platforms to understand and better serve the community of healthcare professionals at scale. They also have an Ambassador Program ([Awesome Humans](https://www.wearfigs.com/pages/awesome-humans)), consisting of over 250 healthcare professionals from around the world, which further drives engagement with the community. In addition to the Ambassador Program, FIGS inspires customer loyalty by building authentic relationships. Through the #FIGSLOVE program, FIGS aims to be part of a professional's career by sending special gifts to them after career milestones like graduating from school or opening a new practice. Among US healthcare professionals and medical students, FIGS has aided and unaided brand awareness of 55% and 22%, respectively. From 2017 to 2020, FIGS grew net revenue from $17.6M to $263.1M with a 146% CAGR. Of the customers acquired from 2017 to 2019, approximately 50% returned for a second purchase.

FIGS only recently achieved profitability and may not maintain profitability in the future. Additionally, the recent rapid growth may not be sustainable or indicative of future growth, and they expect the growth rate to ultimately slow over time. Shipping is a critical part of the business and changes can adversely affect operations. There is reliance on a limited number of third-party suppliers to provide material for and produce products which could cause problems in the supply chain.

**CONCLUSION**

Given the recent IPO, I expect there to be some price movement and for it to drop in the upcoming weeks. I will wait for a better reentry price. With that said, healthcare apparel continuously needs to be replenished, resulting in highly predictable, recurring demand. FIGS has room to grow over the next 3-5 years and I like it as a longer term investment.

I currently own bith ootions and long stock for each company and wanted to get a disscusion thread going so we can spread the word and hear some pros/cons from others!! 🚀🚀🚀",237
238,$WDC Western Digital DD: Part 2,"Link to part 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ntqwp7/wdc_western_digital_is_being_driven_up_by_chia/

Chia, a 'green' alternative to GPU mining has caused a global shortage of hard discs. I commented on the increased demand, and the earnings expectations in my previous DD.

Chia uses a proof of space approach to mining that relies on using empty hard disc space. The high profitability of mining thiscaused a surge in demand for hard discs.

However, Chia mining is largely popular in Central and SE Asia right now, with some movement in the West. I expect as more people become aware of this, particularly in the West - it will lead to a shortage of hard discs and SSD's much like the current GPU shortage. There is already a shortage of HDD's/SSD's due to the initial surge of Chia interest causing a buyup of these items. However, as it gains traction, and as people realise how this is much more highly profitable in comparison to GPU mining currently - the demand will be similar to that of GPU's. 

This initial surge I mention, has indeed already caused a surge in the stock prices. With Western digital share price being $52 at the start of the year and now around $77/78. Seagate is also up from $60 to $99. 

Hoffman, the president of Chia Network, says he 'is suprised at the speed at which the hard disc capacity devoted to Chia has grown and admits that this is likely to caused disruptions to the supply chain for some time.'.

In summary, Chia is more profitable and more energy efficient than GPU mining. Hard drive demand has already spiked leading to shortages. I expect as this grows in profitability in Asia and the west, it will lead to further shortages much like that we see of HDD's.
Therefore driving up the stock price as already has been shown.",238
239,How has the Reddit effect impacted cannabis stocks?,"On Tuesday 9th February, a user who claimed to make over 500,000 USD in earnings from the famous cannabis stocks Tilray and Aphrra boosted told the forum’s 8.8 million members that they still had a lot more room to rise. 


His post quickly started trending and today has around 13000 upvotes and 1200 comments.


Tilray has been in the news quite a lot lately. The Canada based, US listed company has been riding a wave of good news. It has made agreements to export its products to Europe, and is set to merge with Aphria to create the largest cannabis company. No wonder it has drawn attention from both hedge funds and private investors on r/wallstreetbets.


Since December 2020, when the merger announcement was first made, Tilray’s share price has jumped around 400%, while Aphria has grown 243%. Other companies are also riding this wave: Canopy Growth’s shares have doubled, and so has ETFMG Alternative Harvest, a fund tracking cannabis stocks all over the world.


Since Wednesday 10th February, Reddit Day traders have started showing a lot of interest in cannabis stocks. Both Tilray and Aphria have seen sudden spikes in demand, and their share prices increased 21% and 10% respectively. However, just like Gamestop, this interest was short lived.


On the other hand, short interest in Cannabis stocks is also high. According to Reuters, approximately 37% of Tilray’s free float (shares which are being actively traded in the market) is currently loaned out to hedge funds, up from 27.3% in January.


Hedge funds are also quite familiar with cannabis companies. For example, in 2018, Tilray’s price skyrocketed from $20 to $300 in the three months following legalization, and forced short sellers to hastily cover their positions by buying stocks (which were also not quite readily available for purchase). 


Nonetheless, according to Yahoo Finance, right now,  there is an approximately 51% short interest in Cannabis stocks by hedge funds and institutional investors. 


The only question remains is this, will the Reddit Effect make Tilray and Aphria the new Gamestop?

240,$BB ideas for Monday,"Disclaimer: I got out from $BB on Friday.

$BB dropped below $14.30 (50% Fib Retracement mark). This mark was tested and rejected multiple time from Thursday through Friday. However at around 2pm $BB dropped bellow. Bulls immediately tried regaining this level but got rejected and we closed below. The next level is 61.8%, $13. Bulls must hold this one in my opinion. There's a big hole that is still unfilled when $BB gapped up from June 1st to 2nd. If $BB goes below $13, then we might retest June 1st closing of $11.56 and 78.6% retracement mark of $11.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/Pv2AQcyz/

Volume on Friday also wasn't great. Comparing it to Thursday is a bit unfair since that was a record breaking day. That being said, Friday volume was a half of what it was on Wednesday. This was also $BBs first negative day of this run. Looking back to January, first negative day of that run also coincided with lower volume and that was basically the end of that run. Volume was keep decreasing since that day going forward. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/onHdg7BE/

On Monday:

* If $BB opens above $14.30, it will most likely try and retest 50% retracement again. If we hold above, might be a good place to jump back in. 

* If $BB opens between $14.30 and $13, just wait and see, that's noman's land. If $BB starts to slide then I'm looking for a strong rejection at $13 before even thinking about jumping back in. If we go below $13, then there are good chances we'll retest $11.5 and $11 marks. If $BB starts the morning strong and goes up, watch what happens at $14.30. Going above and stabilizing that is a good sign. 
* And of course I'm looking for better volume than last Friday if there's to be continuation of this run.",240
241,AMC has been having a wild time. SO HYPE. TO THE MOON!!!,,241
242,Why you should be gambling on EDIT leaps instead of gambling on volatile meme stocks. TW: Long sentences,"Hello fellow apes and retards, and welcome to my TED talk. While all of you are creaming your pants losing 50% of your money by repeatedly throwing it into a furnace of GME calls fueled by the theta flames of hell, let me introduce you to a better way.

CRISPR.

For those of you who don't know what the fuck this random buzzword that sounds like a hip burnt pizza restaurant is, let me summarize for you:

 - Scientists (smarter than you) found a neat little protein in bacteria called cas9 in 2005 that did something really cool. It was able to take scissors, and cut out fuckups from its DNA that were introduced by viruses. Think of it like a bacteria that can get HIV, and then delete it.

 - Turns out, cas9 is really fucking versatile, and could defend against nearly *all* viruses that the bacteria would regularly encounter, because of CRISPR genes in the bacteria. You don't need to care about what it stands for, just think about it like duplicates of non-infecting DNA from viruses. The cas9 complex then takes the synthesizing RNA for these sequences (try really hard to remember 9th grade bio), grabs onto it, and uses it as a guideline to scissor out the bad DNA.

 - After some fucking around, scientists recently have been able to give little cas9 bro almost **any** RNA and it can take it, and use it as a guide to remove DNA that matches it.

So what does this mean for humans?

 - In 2016 Editas Medicine went public, becoming the first company to focus on eventual clinical studies of using CRISPR-Cas9 complex in humans to modify their DNA to cure incurable diseases. 

 - In january 2021, the company received clinical green light for trials for **sickle cell** patients.

   - What is sickle cell? A really fucked up disease where your blood is the wrong shape and it causes life-long pain and poor ability to absorb oxygen correctly. The only therapeutic procedures for this are extremely expensive apheresis treatments in which sickled cells are removed and replaced with good cells, which eventually die and become sickled again, requiring constant therapeutic treatment for patients.

 - There are 4.4 million people with sickle cell disease, *all* of whom would be very glad for an actual long term treatment.

Sure okay okay, but what does this mean for retards like me with regular shaped blood? Well you are in luck, because this company with the potential to become one of the largest medical companies in the world is only sitting at $2.4B market cap. A company with the most CRISPR research, and the most clinical trial experience in CRISPR therapy, has a market cap of about 10% of a dying video game reseller. A company that could cure all cancers, cure HIV, even let rich people pay for super babies, is only $2.4B. 

If clinical trials for sickle cell go well (we will find out before EOY), you can bet your wife's boyfriend's left and right nuts that EDIT will 10x and then 10x again before 2023. This is the biggest capitalistic opportunity of the decade. This is like investing in japan in the 60s, the internet in the 80s, semiconductors in the 90s. This is the launch pad of a rocket that is heading straight past the moon, past the oort cloud, past the edges of the milky way, past the local group, to the edges of the virgo supercluster so fast that time and space will collapse in its wake. 

Positions: 

2x EDIT $90c 1/20/23

3x EDIT $100c 1/20/23

2x EDIT $115c 1/20/23

And many more to come as I get a weekly allowance from my wife's boyfriend.

243,I TRIED TO WARN YOU BUT YOU WOULDN'T LISTEN TO ME!!!!! ASO!!!!!!!!!,"So......

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I been talking about ASO for a few weeks now.  I started when it was maybe 31.  It's over 37.9 now.  more than 20 percent up since I brought it to your attention.  What I came to understand with all the filtered posts, abuse, riding my ass, and other genreally negative feedback, is that this community has unique standards for what qualifies as a stock worth going in on.  You see, read back to the original GME posts and I was all the same bullshit: ""B&M store"", ""doomed to fail"", ""OK BOOMER"".

&#x200B;

Then GME exploded and it made WallStreetBets famous.  It exposed the corrupt and hateful behavior of hedge funds, and millions of people piled on to WSB in the hopes of catching the next wave.

&#x200B;

The problem:  You're all retards.  

&#x200B;

There have been fundamental changes in the way hedge funds operate now because of us.  Yes WallStreetBets kicked ass and changed the world, but YOU didn't.  YOU might have gotten lucky and hopped on when GME was 17 and rode it to 34, hopped off, hopped back on at 70, hopped off at 80, hopped on at 190, etc etc etc.  You also hopped on and off as it went down. losing money most of the time. Some people made good money, or are the true diamondhands we all wish we are, but the great majority are just plebs giving our money to smarter traders, making small gains here and there, etc.  

And the majority of YOU are also now jumping on AMC, BB, etc.  Not having any idea really what is going to happen, making or losing money as the wind blows, thinking you are part of a movement that is leveling the playing field for apes and retards.  So what does someone like YOU do???

&#x200B;

Well, I'm here to help! (disclaimer: I'm NOT here to help)

&#x200B;

This is what you're missing:

The way GME happened, the way BB and AMC and MVIS and BNGO happened, isn't by your FOMO fool ass jumping in (actually the tail part of it is but we'll get to that later), it happened because DD's occurred with critical analysis of stocks that were undervalued were placed here, and some smart people OTHER than you read it and understood it.  They bought and held for months, bringing up the floor value of the stock long enough that some other reasonably smart but less responsible investors took notice.  Then when they got in the price went up more, until a LOT of people noticed.  A lot of YOU people.  Of course you jumped in with FOMO, but you jumped in as they started selling off.  Then you started posting desperate attempts to get the stock to go up but you have no karma and have nothing meaningful to add so your paosts got filtered and all you could do is post ""me too"" like some brain dead AOL'er on other peoples posts.  

The era of GME and 80+ percent shorted stocks is gone now.  You changed that.  You didn't profit from it but you got the frenzy going, participated in it, and kicked Melvin's ass.  

&#x200B;

So what to do now?  Stop chasing! Yes you might win a casino bet concerning AMC now but ultimately (and AMC agrees), the stock is way over valued now and most of you are going to lose money.  Also, like all casino bets, ultimately the casino wins.  

&#x200B;

Every once in a while a stock comes up here that is undervalued and has enough short interest, etc, that you might get a nice gamma squeeze out of it.  I think the best bet is to look at those, CRITICALLY, and decide if it's worth throwing in.

&#x200B;

THEN WAIT.

If the stock is actually undervalued (like BB, AMC, GME were originally), you might get a nice pop, an incredible pop even.  But patience is key, and even if you don't get a pop the stock will still do well.  

&#x200B;

So what does this have to do with ASO?  Well its undervalued, fairly shorted, mostly institutionally owned, and waiting to get noticed.  Should you buy?

&#x200B;

WELL  IT'S TOO LATE!!!!!!!!  

THE STOCK ANNOUNCES EARNINGS TOMORROW MORNING YOU IDIOT!!! TOO LATE TO BUY CALLS.  

&#x200B;

I WARNED YOU BUT YOU DIDN'T LISTEN TO ME.  WATCH THE TICKER TOMORROW MORNING AND WATCH OTHER PEOPLE WIN AGAIN!!!!!!!!
