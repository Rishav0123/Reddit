6,6,"$TLRY (DD) - Why Tilray could be a leading cannabis stock to add to your portfolio Due to the volatility of this stock, I’ve taken a perspective from an industry outlook to justify that Tilray presents potential growth as a leading cannabis company in the next few years. If you are looking for a cannabis stock to buy then [TLRY](https://utradea.com/stocks/TLRY) might be a solid pick. The company presents a strong infrastructure with a multinational supply chain and distribution network, as well as strategic acquisitions that position them for long-term growth in a high-growth market.

Company Overview

**Tilray Inc. (NASDAQ:** [**TLRY**](https://utradea.com/stocks/TLRY)**, TSE: TLRY)** engages in the research, cultivation, production and distribution of medical cannabis and cannabinoids. The company supplies high-quality medical cannabis products to tens of thousands of patients in 17 countries spanning 5 continents through their subsidiaries in Australia, Germany, Latin America, Portugal, and Canada. They only operate in countries where cannabis or hemp-derived cannabinoids are legal and permitted under applicable federal, state, provincial and local laws. Tilray continues to be a pioneer in the development of the global cannabis market and was one of the first companies to be licensed by Health Canada to cultivate medical and to be a licensed seller in Canada. They were also the first company to legally export medical cannabis from North America to countries in Europe, Africa, Latin America, etc.

**Brand and Products:**

The Tilray brand is their medical brand that’s been established as a global medical cannabis brand and is designed to appeal to prescribers and patients in the global medical market.

High Park Holdings Ltd. is their subsidiary that was established to develop, produce, sell and distribute adult-use cannabis produces for recreational purposes

* Portfolio and pricing strategies designed to compete in all tiers and product categories of the Canadian adult-use market to maintain and grow their market share
* Brands such as:  

   * Canaca – a brand that is built upon a homegrown heritage with products such as pre-rolls, oil products and pure cannabis vapes
   * Marley Natural – crafted with a focus on wellness and the positive potential of the herb
   * Chowie Wowie - an edibles brand offering an array of reliably dosed cannabis-infused chocolates and gummies in THC and CBD
   * Everie – a joint venture with Labatt Breweries of Canada offering non-alcoholic CBD-infused beverages with 98% pure CBD isolate and all-natural flavours
   * Many more brands

**Tilray Inc.’s strategy** focuses on approaching the business from a long-term and global perspective. The company “aspires to build the world’s most trusted and valuable global cannabis and hemp company through several key strategies” such as:

* Partnering with established distributors and retailers
* Developing a differentiated portfolio of brands and products to appeal to diverse sets of patients and consumers
* Leveraging their production capacity in North American and Europe to meet current and long-term demand growth that is to be expected

Financial Information

**Revenue:** Tilray’s operating results are reported in two business segments: (1) licensed cannabis and (2) unlicensed hemp. Total cannabis revenue totalled $133,605,000 USD and accounted for 63.5% of total revenue. Of the total cannabis revenue, the adult-use channel generated the most at 62.7%, followed by international medical use, Canada’s medical use and bulk sales contributing the least. Total hemp revenue totalled $76,877,000 USD and accounted for 35.5% of the total revenue. YoY revenue change increased 26% that was driven by 25% growth in the cannabis segment and 28% by the hemp segment.

**General Expenses:** Tilray’s biggest expenses in FY2020 were their general and administrative expenses which totalled $85,883,000 USD or 41% of the revenue. Despite this high expense, it showed a YoY decrease of 23% compared to 2019 due to the realization of implemented cost savings initiatives that saw a reduced headcount of 258 positions and also a non-recurring cost of $4.8 million for severance payments.

**Gross Margin:** Tilray has a gross margin of 12% for FY 2020 that increased from 2019 comparable period of -14%.

* **Gross Margin for Cannabis:** Tilray’s 3% gross margin in 2020 improved from the comparable period in 2019 primarily due to reduced inventory valuation adjustments and overall improvements in their cost of production relating to their cost-cutting efforts. If excluding inventory adjustments, then gross margin increased by 23% from 20% in 2019 and the improvement is attributable to the increased sales in the international medical markets and the introduction of new products into the adult-use market. 
* **Gross Margin for Hemp:** Tilray’s gross margin of 37% in 2020 increased compared to 2019 due to reduced inventory adjustments. If excluding inventory adjustments, we come to a gross margin percentage of 42% that represents a decrease from 2019 and this is due to the increased promotional activity for their hemp products. 

Recent Developments

On December 15, 2020, Tilray Inc. and Aphria Inc. entered into an agreement that would unite two of the biggest names in the legal cannabis industry. Under the terms of this agreement, each Aprhia share will be exchanged for 0.8381 of a Tilray share and as a result of this exchange ratio, Aphria shareholders will own 62% of the combined company’s common shares. This nearly $4B deal was closed last month in May and formally merged the two companies. With Aphria’s recreational position in Canada combined with Tilray’s strength in the international markets, this merger will make Tilray an industry leader in the Canadian pot market and in a position to generate more growth in many more markets.

**“Our focus now turns to execution on our highest return priorities including business integration and accelerating our global growth strategy”** – CEO Irwin Simon after the deal was closed

Industry Statistics and Outlook

* The global cannabis market is estimated to be valued at $20.5B in 2020 and projected to reach $90.4B by 2026 – representing a CAGR of 28%  

   * Market primarily to be driven by the medical use of cannabis and the legalization of marijuana
   * North American accounted for the largest market share of 79.6% in 2020 for both medical and recreational purposes
   * Europe projected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period due to increasing legalization
   * Adult-use segment dominated the market with a revenue share of 54.6% in 2020 and expected to expand at the highest CAGR during the forecast period
* The global cannabis beverages market estimated to reach $2.8B by 2025 and grow at a CAGR of 17.8% from 2019 to 2025  

   * Heavily fragmented market due to the presence of medium and small-scale companies
   * With Tilray’s entry into this market already combined with the Aphria merger (with the acquisition of SweetWater), Tilray has a strong backing and R&D to take over a lot of the North American market share
* The Canadian cannabis industry is worth an estimated $2.2B in annual sales   

   * Second fastest-growing industry in Canada at more than 28% annually

Investment Thesis: Strategic Acquisitions and Mergers

Aphria’s strong balance sheet and financials provide a great platform for future profitability and cash flow generation with many growth opportunities. As well, the combined company will have access to capital giving the company the power to easily accelerate its growth and deliver attractive returns for shareholders. 

Together with Aprhia, Tilray has a portfolio of carefully curated brands with diverse product offerings across all consumer segments. Tilray’s merger with Aphria will increase its Canadian market share and further diversify its available product offerings. Aphria’s acquisition of SweetWater Brewing Company, a cannabis lifestyle branded craft brewer, in November 2020 gave the business a position in setting up to sell cannabis-infused beverages once legal in the U.S. As well, Tilray’s most recent agreement with Authentic Brands Group and also the acquisition of Manitoba Harvest, a leading hemp food manufacturer and pioneer in branded CBD and wellness products, will also allow Tilray to penetrate the U.S market and enter a new line of products. Currently with the merger, Tilray will offer products in every major cannabis category such as flower, pre-roll, oils, capsules, vapes, edibles and beverages and establish a stronger brand and presence worldwide.

With potential legislation changes ahead towards the legalization of marijuana, it will give the industry immense potential for growth in the coming years. With established segments in cannabis-infused beverages through SweetWater and hemp, CBD and wellness products through Manitoba Harvest, Tilray is positioned with strong financials to execute its growth strategy. When marijuana becomes legal in other parts of the world, Tilray will be well-positioned to compete in the market given its strong brand and distribution system in place. 

Risks

**Competition from the illicit cannabis market could impact their ability to succeed.** Competition from marijuana black markets limits Tilray’s ability to potentially increase product pricing. Despite the legalization of medical and adult-use cannabis in Canada, illegal dispensaries and black markets are abundant and a direct competitor to their business. In addition, these illicit market operations may offer products with higher concentrations than what is prohibited under Canadian regulations and may offer lower prices. This adversely affects Tilray’s market share and potential sales.

**Research of the health effects of medical cannabis is relatively new and subject to further study which could impact demand for their medical cannabis products.** Research regarding the viability, safety, efficacy and dosing of cannabis or isolated cannabinoids such as CBD and THC remains in early stages. Future research and clinical trials may draw opposing conclusions to Tilray’s business and adversely affect the social acceptance of cannabis and demand for its products.

9,9,"Shorting is not bad / not going away As a 20+ year daytrader I thought I just weigh-in with this fact: 
shorting is an indispensable tool of the financial markets. 

As a 60/40 short biased trader, I’m not saying that for my self-interest. I can, and do, make money both directions each and every day. I’m saying it because this sub (WSB) has (rightly or wrongly) been ascribed an aversion to, and a desire to abolish, the ability to short stocks. 

Everyone should be against NAKED short selling. That is an abomination that should absolutely be stomped out - and I also believe it is rampant. Naked short selling makes a mockery of the entire market and I’m proud the apes are finally on the verge of exposing it to the world. 

Every time I’ve been asked in my life what shorting a stock means, I’ve gone through the same numerous factors that make shorting possible: and they always include locating shares to borrow, and paying a fee if necessary, to initiate the position. The idea that institutions are filling retail buy orders with shares that don’t even exist really blows my mind and should shake the faith of all market participants. 
 
But retail and institutional investors being able to short stocks they feel are highly overvalued really does serve to prevent the pervasive & consistent mis-pricing of assets. This prevents small groups of persons/entities from ‘cornering the market’ on numerous low float illiquid stocks (and others). And of course there’s the liquidity argument. And on and on blah blah. 

Thoughts???"

12,12,"Some CLOV technicals from a dummy A few things to note from the CLOV chart:

&#x200B;

* Volume bars on 4/16 and 4/19 are totally insane. Has to be institutional accumulation, a great sign.

&#x200B;

* Anchored VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) pinch from high and low of 2021 — watch for some bouncing around in this area and a break to the upside (hopefully).

&#x200B;

* Price now above curling upward 50-65 SMA cloud **and** curling upward 20-23 EMA cloud.

&#x200B;

* Resting on volume shelf below — if it dips, watch for a bounce (hopefully) off the $8.50 - $8.75 area, buyers seems to be interested in that level.

&#x200B;

* Breakout levels to watch marked on chart with the thick dotted line: $9.25 and $10.56. These are levels I drew myself and are definitely **not** 100% accurate.

&#x200B;

* Above $10.56 looking at a resistance volume shelfs between $12 - $13, then a smaller shelf between $14 - $14.30. Above that looking at relatively smooth sailing to break through all time highs of $17.45.

&#x200B;

* Maybe all these levels get blown away by a squeeze? I don't know.

&#x200B;

* Remember that I'm dumb. Do your own thing.

13,13,"$BB - Expect Large Movements Within 1 Month - Part 6  Welcome back to another episode of ""Can Virtual-Pin1025 Predict the Future?""  
After Friday's action, the conclusion is no, but let's look at the chart and see what's going on.

What happened on Friday:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x2wmukqxbp371.png?width=1916&format=png&auto=webp&s=01459ffc0e98d47ef446f563fcf853f0fff36af1

The first real red day in 2 weeks lost support at the $14.50 USD mark but also had reduced volume. Can't win them all. We should consider this pullback extremely healthy and does not interfere with the overall bull trend as we were exceeding the Bollinger bands for 5 straight trading days. Exceeding the Bollinger bands is considered to be a strong indicator of volatility, and I strongly believe we have more volatility to come. I would also assume traders were taking their anywhere from 60%-100% profits off the table.

We did not bounce back up to the $24-$33 range as I expected on Friday, but again opinions are like assholes. Everyone has one. I believe that range is easily accessible still through this coming trading week.

Signs that make me bearish:  
\-1D chart RSI is still quite high but is reaching back into a healthy range.  
\-Lower volume Friday. But the overall market was low and red so I'm not too concerned.  
\-Gap to be filled on the chart. \~$11.56-12.30. Usually, gaps do get filled on charts but not always in the short term.  
\-Loss of the 14.50 support. On the hourly chart we had a small bounce in that range on Thursday after the massive opening and slightly recovered, a bounce again just after open on Friday but ultimately failed for the rest of the day. This is a volume issue and many taking profits/losses trying to swing trade.  
\-Possibility of reaching $12.10, if that fails next stop is probably \~$11.30

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nvjhe4fybp371.png?width=1811&format=png&auto=webp&s=817de62d8aedc2eacb1a9bcbbb5e3ac73bf1a80e

These are the bearish signals that I can find and are important to note but again the overall bull trend still exists on a daily, and when in doubt zoom out is the motto. One bad day does not mean you have a bad life.

Signs that make me bullish:  
\-We ended the day inside the top end of the Bollinger bands and they appear to not be contracting yet on the daily chart.  
\-20 DMA and 50DMA have just crossed. This is called a golden cross and the 200DMA is now beginning to slope upwards.  
\-Large amount of strength in the $13.00 range. If you look back at the hourly chart above where we ended Friday you can see where it is flat in comparison to on Wednesday. This shows strong support in this range and will be a powerful foundation to build a cup and handle formation. This range was also significant in the previous run in January

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qj063yzybp371.png?width=1868&format=png&auto=webp&s=703841beac1005b97a1849c19ddc18187fee799f

\-Still a large following and people interested in $BB this weekend across forums, subreddits, and media. #1 ticker on WSB Thursday and Friday.  
\-Largest open interest of stock options is $20 USD.  
\-Put/call ratio still relatively low  
\-Small short shares available (Squeeze is in the realm of possibilities again)  
\-RSI looks healthy on the hourly for a dead cat bounce at open  
\-Currently, one of the best plays technically speaking but also fundamentally for the long term (1-2 years+).  
\-I have confirmation bias because cybersecurity is a massive growth market. If you didn't hear, JBS is the world's largest supplier of beef, and got hacked might actually cause a shortage of beef in the supermarkets or a large squeeze in beef prices. Go long on beef and cybersecurity.  
\-Institutions are still accumulating. Remember, around 48% of BB is owned by institutions and insiders. This is massive. One of the largest companies with large institutional ownership is Microsoft at \~70% or Facebook with an %80. We aren't that far off with a much much lower share count.

If the share price goes down significantly tomorrow I'll post another update, only because if the share price goes down with such a small amount of short shares available I believe this will only be tightening the slingshot further that would rocket $BB's share price to the $30s.

Things that we need to continue to look for:  
\-High volume  
\-Amount of posts and articles about $BB on Reddit, commercial websites, and other forums  
\-News or statements from $BB. One piece of news that's significant could be the catalyst to a moonshot.

This week's price target remains the same as what I wanted on Friday. Anywhere $24-$33USD.

Take care, and stay healthy. Go drink some water, please."
14,14,"CLOV - Big Daddy of All Squeezes DD I want to start off by saying this is not a post comparing CLOV to GME or AMC. While these stocks have some similarities, particularly being targeted by hedge funds for short squeezes, I’m not going to get into that. This post is for anyone who is somewhat new to investing, still learning about shorts and squeezes, and those of you who are more knowledgeable but want the full picture of what’s going on with this stock. You can also think of this post as a Part 2 to [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CLOV/comments/ngesez/this_is_the_bottom_and_youll_be_top_of_the_world/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Brief description of my last post - it was about the stock reaching its bottom at $6.80 and only going up from there (which was correct).

**TL;DR - Currently, the highest number of options purchased have a strike price between $7-18 for every single month. The goal is to stay above $12 to create a snowball of options being executed, thereby causing a gamma squeeze - the higher the strike price, the higher the limit to execute and the hedges are worse off.**

**What Is Clover Health?**

Clover Health is not just another insurance company. They have combined Medicare insurance services with new patient-centered technology aimed at facilitating the ease and effectiveness of diagnosis, treatment, and most importantly, prevention. This company should not be classified as a health insurance company, but a tech company. Their AI learning and database, Clover Assistant, make it easier for providers to eliminate unnecessary and repetitive lab testing, repetitive diagnoses, and it consolidates a patient’s medical history into one platform. This not only saves the patient headaches from navigating our decentralized healthcare system, but it also saves both patients and insurance companies an enormous amount of money by avoiding duplicated efforts. 

Currently, CLOV covers 66,300 customers across 8 states out of the 61,212,247 Medicare beneficiaries nationwide, which equates to .0011% of the beneficiary population. As you can tell, this number is extremely low, which makes sense since they are a brand new company. When they reach even 1% of the beneficiaries, this company’s stock price would be $100+ based on fundamentals alone. But I expect these numbers to skyrocket as they gain more members and their AI learning database improves more and more.

[CLOV Medicare Advantage Plan by &#37; of growth compared to competitors \(cloverhealth.com\)](https://preview.redd.it/wuoalim07q371.png?width=3297&format=png&auto=webp&s=b38cba4adeb4fcbbeae5d53ea93751964480113a)

CLOV has huge long-term growth potential, so the risk to reward is extremely favorable towards getting into the squeeze. Let me explain why.

**Positive Catalysts**

All the negative catalysts are out of the way and everything is priced in. Here are some positives I’m keeping an eye on: 

* DOJ/SEC case dropping or settling (even if CLOV is found guilty of taking advantage of Medicare, it will still be positive because at max they’ll pay a fine and that’ll be over with). I highly doubt CLOV will be found guilty though because the Hindenburg claims are rather baseless and the DOJ were forced to inquire about this only because it’s related to Medicare. 
* Biden’s health care proposal reducing the Medicare qualifying age below 65 would create millions of new beneficiaries. The hype around the proposal alone will create a huge stock price increase in all healthcare-related stocks, so CLOV will definitely benefit.
* CLOV is officially added to the Russell 3000, who will have to purchase a ton of CLOV shares.
* PR of any new partnership, expanding to further states, and increasing current partnerships. They’re growing rapidly as is, so news like this is bound to come out in the near future.

**The Dark Clouds Surrounding CLOV**

* As previously mentioned, the DOJ inquiry is still lingering and it’s unclear when it will be settled. Although it’s priced in, it is still something to watch out for.
* Hindenturd’s constant attacks despite insisting they don’t have any positions. Why would Hindenburg attack Chamath Palihapitiya even though they aren’t benefiting from it, according to themselves? This relates to the GME/AMC squeeze; Chamath was a big proponent of the push against the hedges. He was outspoken about the squeeze on several occasions and gave GME his validation, which in turn hurt Citadel and other hedges shorting GME immensely. Hindenburg’s report was created to hurt all of Chamath’s IPOs, especially CLOV. Basically, this is retaliation against Chamath for standing with the retail investors, and if I had to take a wild guess, Citadel has paid Hindenburg to write this baseless report. I’ve added a link at the bottom of this post about the Hindenburg allegations and the counter from CLOV for those who were not aware of all the allegations. (PS - Despite all the negative press surrounding Chamath, his track record is stellar.)
* The constant manipulation by short sellers to create negative incentive. For instance, the fake lawsuits by Lifshitz that are shady at best; if you go to their website, you’ll find the phone number listed goes straight to voicemail. All their social media lead to Wix.com platforms instead of their own. And, **THEIR PHYSICAL LOCATION DOES NOT EXIST** as shown in Google Maps. Lots of red flags.

**Let’s get down to the nitty gritty - The Daddy of all Short Squeezes**

CLOV is currently over 42.58% as of Friday, making it the highest shorted stock on paper (and it’s unclear how many naked shorts there are, which could easily be 70-100%+; it’s impossible to know since those shares are shorted illegally). THE SQUEEZE IS INEVITABLE, it’s just a matter of how much more the short interest increases, which will correlate to a bigger squeeze. Furthermore, the borrowed interest on CLOV stock has more than doubled to 3.7%, meaning those who are shorting have to pay much higher interest on borrowing the stocks, and that number will only continue to increase as demand increases. Soon, they won’t be able to borrow anymore stocks and will have to short it naked in order to suppress the price further, essentially digging a gargantuan hole in which to bury themselves.

[CLOV S\/I&#37; as reported by Ortex](https://preview.redd.it/yem0laz57q371.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0602994d6bc0ddc1305c2737a8b1d70de3f7c58)

No need to fear the company dumping their shares or diluting it because the Class B shares are locked up - the directors aren’t able to sell any shares until the stock price stays above $30 for 90 consecutive days or more. The company is $700 million cash flow positive and no debt, therefore there won’t be any dilution.

The P/S ratio is considered a particularly good metric for evaluating young, potentially high growth companies or companies in cyclical industries that may not show an actual net profit every year. Let’s talk about CLOV’s P/S ratio for a moment. 

CLOV’s 2020 revenue was $672.9 million compared to $462.3 million in 2019, which puts it at 45.6% increase in growth. They beat their own expectations and those of analysts by a wide margin. In 2018 and 2019, the market valued tech companies with IPOs at an average of 11.7 and 10.4 times (respectively) their previous 12 month earnings. Conservatively, that would put CLOV at $7 billion market cap, which is around $20+ fair value. But in 2020, that number doubled, which would increase CLOV’s market cap significantly. However, for this consideration, I’m using the 2018/19 valuation to be conservative.

**Bottom Line**

The fair value of CLOV is anywhere from $20-30 fundamentally, which makes it a very risk-free, undervalued stock that has been suppressed by short sellers. But this post is not about the fundamentals - this is about exposing the short sellers’ manipulation of CLOV. On paper, this company is shorted 42.58% (though this is MUCH higher when you include the illegal naked shorts that aren’t reported), making it the highest shorted stock as of Friday. This number could go much higher as short sellers continue to borrow stocks and suppress the price further, which only hurts them more the longer this is shorted. As is common knowledge from previous squeezes, hedge funds are not going to cover anytime soon; they have to be forced by triggering their margins. As the Fed hinted recently, hedge funds are the most leveraged they’ve ever been in the last 20 years, which means retail investors can take advantage of them just like they’ve been taking advantage of retail investors for 100s of years.

I don’t know how much it could squeeze, from $50-150 or much higher, and there’s no telling where the ceiling will end up. The squeeze is inevitable, whether you or I buy it or not, but the process of how long it will take is up to the retail investing community.

# Products & Customers

* BlackBerry isn't just a phone company any more. They provide best in class cybersecurity.
* BlackBerry's most notable product is QNX, an RTOS with several applications. [Read here for more.](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le53ol/comprehensive_guide_about_bb_and_how_it_shall/)
* In December of last year, Amazon announced a multi-year global agreement with BlackBerry QNX and developed IVY, a cloud-connected smart vehicle data platform. IVY allows automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data and create actionable insights from that date. It's possibilities are endless, and I highly recommend reading more on Amazon's initial announcement.
* OK, so what the fuck does the point above mean? It means that **right now, electric vehicles are a gold rush, and BlackBerry is the one selling picks and shovels.** Through Amazon, IVY is going to become an integral part of the EV process.
* The market is sucking the dick of EV manufacturers, but EV production is low margin and low scale. **BlackBerry IVY is data monetization, which is high margin and has unlimited scale.** Within a few years, BlackBerry will be making much more than the auto manufacturers they're partnered with.
* Blackberry QNX is used by 23 of the world's top 25 electric vehicle OEMs.
* BlackBerry targets more than just EVs though. They also have or are developing products for healthcare, financial services, government markets, energy, gas, oil, and smart grid connected transportation.

# Cybersecurity Leader

* BB offers best-in-class security, safety, and reliability. 18 of the G20 governments are customers, and they are the only software company to attain various security certifications from the US Govt.
* Ransomware attacks have begun to impact American businesses like never before. Today, the commerce secretary stated ransomware attacks are here to stay, and that businesses should plan accordingly.
* You know that oil pipeline that was taken out by DarkSide ransomware and caused oil shortages across the southeast U.S? That wouldn't have happened if Colonial Pipeline were using BlackBerry. Something tells me companies won't be making that mistake in the future.
* According to Frost & Sullivan Research, BlackBerry addresses 96% of cyber threats, and 77% of Fortune 100 financial companies use BlackBerry software.

[Here's a list of BB Certifications obtained in 2020.](https://preview.redd.it/qey899yxnp371.png?width=1259&format=png&auto=webp&s=f51e571ce7afcaf17126b2c168cb3f7a37343c35)

# Some Basics and Fundamentals

* BlackBerry has an \~$8bn market cap with $1bn+ in yearly revenue and $800m in cash.
* Since 2016, the number of QNX products has grown from 50 million to 175 million.
* BB owns \~38,000 patents worth approximately $450 million.
* BB recently won a lawsuit against Facebook. I am unable to find the details, but most estimates are for between $1bn - $5bn total, paid over the course of a few years. BlackBerry's current market cap is only $8bn...
* Blackberry has a strong customer base of critical infrastructure already, and their pivot from hardware to software means continuous subscription revenue.
* **If BlackBerry had the same market cap as competitor Crowdstrike -** **who it outperforms** **- it would have a stock price of $83.** That's just taking into consideration one aspect of it's business model.
* [Vanguard has doubled their position since Dec 31/2020.](https://np.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lzw0pn/vanguard_is_bullish_on_bb/)

# TL;DR: 🚀🚀🚀 BB is going past the moon and into Alpha Centauri. This company is so much more than a meme stock or a short term squeeze - it's a life changing opportunity. When BlackBerry starts getting IVY revenue, $20 will look like a joke and you'll have to explain to your wife's boyfriend why you didn't get in under $14 when you had the chance.

# BIG EDIT:

**I was asked about the bear case for BB. It's important to understand the risks of investing, and I'm not so in love with this stock that I'm blind, so here's the bear case:**

* A lot of investors have been underwhelmed by revenue so far, and BlackBerry missed their expectations for Q4 2020. But it's worth noting the reason for buying BlackBerry right now is that when IVY revenue starts rolling in these concerns will wash away. It's a longer term play, similar to Palantir.
* The bull case assumes CEO John Chen's estimate of being able to get roughly $500m for their patents is correct. If they get less than expected for that side of their business, or keep the patents and aren't able to monetize them in a meaningful way, that would be less than ideal.
* The Facebook settlement could end up being more like 500m than the 2bn+ that's expected.
* They could be passed in the cybersecurity field before they are able to leverage their current best in class service. This one is really unlikely considering how many other companies have tried to make products equivalent to what BlackBerry has - and failed.
* EV companies could end up making their own OS and data services to resist IVY adoption. Several are trying (Tesla always comes in this conversation as an example), but from everything I've read none have managed to make as safe and comprehensive a system as BlackBerry.

So, *if* IVY doesn't get adopted, they're no longer the leading cybersecurity company, their lawsuit is for less money than expected, and their patents are actually worthless - then BlackBerry is only a little undervalued instead of incredibly undervalued.

**Here's the most meaningful bear case right now though, and how the bulls can beat it:**

There seems to be a lot of upward resistance. Establishments, institutions, etc. are all convinced BB is a failed phone company stock worth $10. When it rises, large financial players short (because they believe they can buy back for $10 or less), buy puts, or just scalp to try and capitalize on the volatility which in turn creates a lot of resistance and breaks momentum.

I don't think there's any conspiracy, I think the big players are just incompetent. These are pretty normal pullbacks and reactions to a stock that's gaining so quickly. The problem is that those big financial players I mentioned (as well as a lot of people on WSB) don't understand *why* this stock is so desirable. They just think it's a meme stock that's being pumped and don't understand the potential of: A) Becoming an essential step of EV manufacturing; B) Being best in class security during an age of ransomware attacks. So instead of getting in and riding the momentum, they create a self fulfilling prophecy of pullbacks.

**The bulls can win the same way we've won in GME and AMC - by buying and holding. Continued days of large volume will completely fuck the bears who started taking huge short positions last week, leading to even bigger price movement. Buying shares or LEAPS and being patient is the way to play it and win big.** The bears win when bulls waste all their capital buying FDs that have no chance of finishing ITM or when they see a dip and paper hand their shares. It's funny to watch people freak out at a $2 dip when they easily could have just hedged that with a deep OTM weekly covered call. **Buy** ➡️ **Hold** ➡️  **Yacht**

Regardless of the resistance that exists at the moment, there will come a day when big finance starts racing to get in on BB - and they'll pretend they were right all along. We've seen it constantly in tech stocks over the past few years. WSB can just expedite the inevitable by getting in on BB while it's still incredibly cheap."

Of course now im in, it makes perfect sense. **Literally its the perfect stock for this sub, let me explain.**

&#x200B;

**First**, they just came out with their new summer salad. Experts are already stating that this salad is the salad of the summer. See attached citation for review.  ([https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wendys-brings-back-seasonal-summer-strawberry-chicken-salad-301306465.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wendys-brings-back-seasonal-summer-strawberry-chicken-salad-301306465.html))

&#x200B;

**Second,** Wendys social media profile is no stranger to memes. Everyone has seen the ""Roast Me"" thing that Wendys has been doing. Well this will only increase with fellow autists supporting it. Academics have called this term ""metapragmatic roasting"" and its incredibly effective with the younger generation. Here is a chart demonstrating the breakdown of their tweets.

&#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0378216620301120#fig3](https://preview.redd.it/loppdub5mu371.png?width=357&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8c5b8485a2ab060d6c7f2a8585230fbd11dd707)

Here is another article from business daily demonstrating the effectiveness of Wendys perceived social media presence.

&#x200B;

**Third**, Both Gamestop and Wendys have been sharing in this Social Media ""Beef"" or ""Metapragmatic Roasting"" of each other. Their Twitter profiles are actively following each other and going off each others posts. See the below image for an example. ([https://twitter.com/gamestop/status/1224739308013309952?lang=en](https://twitter.com/gamestop/status/1224739308013309952?lang=en))

**Forth, well this one is obvious but Wendys Chicken Tendies. Literally the perfect stock for this sub.**

&#x200B;

So lets talk technical. Supposedly $WEN (Wendy's) has a low public float of around 17 million shares. It has between a 4-10% short which will increase as the stock increases because fast food retail is a relatively predictable stock (Same reason why Utility Companies will get shorted to shit when they rise look at $NEE earlier this year).

&#x200B;

With an average volume of around 1 Million per day there is a huge amount of Alpha to be had in investing in Wendys. Right now the Implied Volatility on options is tiny (29-34%) which means that you can get a position for pennies on the dollar. Further, buying shares is small as well as its currently not a volatile company. Either way its a good investment because of the Salad.

&#x200B;

Im in at $22.97 and calls expiring on January of next year.

&#x200B;

This is not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor. I just really like the stock, and Wendys."

This post will hopefully provide some value to people not familiar with Clover Health (CLOV) and their Medicare Advantage business. CLOV is starting to get a lot of attention because of the addition to the [MSCI index](https://app2.msci.com/eqb/gimi/smallcap/MSCI_May21_SCPublicList.pdf) in May, addition to the [Russell 2000](https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/russell_3000_index_additions_-_2021.pdf) index in June, and the [high short interest](https://fintel.io/ss/us/clov) that could lead to a squeeze. I personally invested in CLOV because of the fundamentals support a $15+ share price.  I'm happy to hold on to this long-term for that reason.

# Full Breakdown of CLOV Valuation

To understand what CLOV should be worth today, look at [OSH](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/OSH/) and [AGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AGL?p=AGL&.tsrc=fin-srch). Not only did all three companies go public within the last year, but they are all similar-sized [Direct Contracting Entities](https://innovation.cms.gov/innovation-models/gpdc-model) (DCE) competing for ""lives under management"" *(Note: you'll see companies report this number using the term patients, members, or beneficiaries. They're all equivalent)*. This term simply means Medicare patients that the company is financially +/- clinically responsible for. Medicare pays $850+ per beneficiary per month for these companies to take on the risk of managing their healthcare costs. You can think of it as a lower margin (5-10% EBITDA) Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model that generates stable recurring revenue on a monthly basis for each patient being managed.

CLOV started out as a Medicare Advantage (MA) insurance plan, which is pretty similar to Direct Contracting (DC). That's because [the DC model was designed based on the MA model](https://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/view/cms-direct-contracting-model---is-it-still-one-of-the-value-based-models-built-on-fee-for-service-chasis-) by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). CMS launched the DC program in April 2021, and CLOV, OSH, and AGL among the first 53 organizations approved.

OSH does a good job of [explaining](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4418419-oak-street-health-bar-of-expectation-may-be-set-little-too-high) how the Medicare Advantage market (and now the DC market) works:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t0utrzxkgp371.png?width=887&format=png&auto=webp&s=f68cd3b940c33b8c41e51c51cd270e8f7208cd8e

MA Plans are insurance companies that partner with specific healthcare providers to help manage the cost of their patients. The MA plan gets the $850+ monthly payment, and is [required by law to spend at least 85%](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2013/05/23/2013-12156/medicare-program-medical-loss-ratio-requirements-for-the-medicare-advantage-and-the-medicare) of it on medical costs. They usually do this by giving 85% of the $850+ monthly payment to the healthcare provider, and thereby transfer the risk of unexpectedly high costs to the provider caring for the patient. The DC model works the same, except Medicare pays the Direct Contracting Entity (DCE) $850+ monthly. What's interesting about DC is that any type of organization can be a DCE. CLOV is an insurance company (MA plan) that creates networks of healthcare providers for their plan members. AGL is a Management Service Organization (MSO) that provides services to healthcare providers that care for Medicare Advantage patients. And OSH *is* a healthcare provider that operates brick-and-mortar clinics focused on Medicare Advantage patients.

Medicare Advantage represents [26 million Americans](https://www.medicareresources.org/medicare-benefits/medicare-advantage/), accounting for about 36 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries. The DC program was launched by CMS so that Medicare Advantage companies like CLOV, AGL, and OSH could help manage the other 46 million Medicare beneficiaries in order to transition away from fee-for-service healthcare. **It's a huge deal.**

Below I'll break down the key numbers driving the valuation of these three companies for their Medicare Advantage business. The DC business is obviously new, but I'll predict what the valuations will look like in DC afterward. **The most important thing to understand here is that the valuation for all three of these companies is the number of lives under management multiplied by a dollar amount. The dollar amount is the market saying how much they believe in the company's ability to profitably manage those patients.**

Disclaimer: I'm not saying all three companies should be valued exactly the same. I am arguing that the dollar amount per managed life should be within a much tighter window because the gross margin for managing a Medicare life (MA or DC) will always end up in a very tight window (5-10% of revenue) no matter what model you deploy.

**OSH = $14.3B market cap**

OSH is obviously liked the most by the market based on their valuation. It's partly because they run the clinics so they can keep more of the Medicare dollar (instead of splitting it with the healthcare provider that takes on the risk). Employing clinicians also allows them to theoretically do more to improve health outcomes and control costs. In this model, the MA Plan takes 15% off the top, and the rest goes to OSH.

* **OSH gross margin = 6.7%** ([source](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/osh/financials))
* **75,500 total managed lives growing to 112,000 this year** ([source](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/oak-street-health-projects-strong-growth-2021-despite-64m-loss-q1))
* **That's a valuation of $125,000 per patient**

**AGL = $14.3B market cap**

AGL holds the contract with the MA plan and then pays the contracted (not employed) healthcare provider. In this model, the MA Plan takes 15% of the premium off the top, and the rest is split between AGL and the provider practices.

* **AGL gross margin = 7%** ([source](https://capital.com/agilon-health-ipo-will-the-stock-soar-in-2021))
* **165,300 total risk-based patients growing to 210,000 this year** ([source](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-agilon-health-ipo/healthcare-platform-agilon-valued-at-about-11-billion-in-nyse-debut-idUSKBN2C22D7))
* **That's a valuation of $66,667 per patient**

**CLOV = $3.65B market cap**

CLOV has historically been just a MA plan, taking the 15% of the premium off the top and paying the rest to cover the patient's costs ([source](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2013/05/23/2013-12156/medicare-program-medical-loss-ratio-requirements-for-the-medicare-advantage-and-the-medicare)). MA plans have an average profit margin of 4.3% after all their admin and sales expenses are accounted for ([source](https://mhk.com/medicare-advantage-is-the-golden-egg-for-health-plans/)).

* **CLOV historical gross margin (before COVID effect) = 2.5-4.1 %** ([source](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/static-files/ed2bc09d-cd96-4759-897e-862c2b250213))
* **132,000 total risk-based patients growing to 160,000 this year** ([source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/17/2230595/0/en/Clover-Health-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results.html))
* **That's a valuation of $22,800 per patient**

**AGL is a good preview of how the DC market could be valued per Medicare patient, except the DC model could be even better. There is no MA plan taking 15% off the top in between the risk-bearer (Direct Contracting Entity: CLOV, AGL, or OSH) and Medicare. Direct Contracting patients could be valued as high as $76,667 (15% premium over current AGL patients).**

The CEO of OSH was recently quoted ""**the per-patient economics of that program will potentially be better than the company had initially estimated""** ([source](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/oak-street-health-projects-strong-growth-2021-despite-64m-loss-q1))**.**

Here are the number of Medicare patients enrolled by each DCE (since the program launched in April 2021):

* **OSH: 6,500** managed lives ([source](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/oak-street-health-projects-strong-growth-2021-despite-64m-loss-q1))
* **AGL**: **50,000** managed lives ([source](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001831097/98fb566d-8f47-4a36-bd48-6bef5745cf56.pdf))
* **CLOV: 65,000** managed lives ([source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/17/2230595/0/en/Clover-Health-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results.html))

Hopefully now those valuation ranges I presented at the top make a little more sense to you.

# Here's an outline of how the Clover Assistant (CA) platform improves treatment decisions and risk adjustment for the provider:

* **More informed doctors delivering better treatment and care**  

   * CA will make treatment recommendations using evidence-based guidelines
   * Primary care providers manage so many different conditions, it's impossible for them to keep up with all the medical literature
   * CA will present the latest evidence-based guidelines as simple recommendations, so that the primary care provider doesn't have to stay up-to-date on the most advanced treatment pathways for every condition
* **More accurate documentation for higher Medicare payments (MA and DC)**  

   * The monthly $850+ payment to MA and DC organizations is adjusted based on the patient's risk score (basically how many health conditions they have)
   * The risk score is calculated using diagnosis codes (ICD-10 codes) that are entered into the electronic health record (EHR) by the doctor and eventually included in the insurance claim that goes to the MA plan (and Medicare)
   * Providers often forget to include all the codes in the insurance claim, or even sometimes forget to properly document it in the EHR
   * Providers also forget to re-document codes on an annual basis, because on January 1 all of the diagnosis codes are erased in Medicare's risk score calculation because some diagnoses can change (e.g. cancer remission)  

      * This sounds stupid, but if a diabetic patient has an amputated foot, Medicare acts like it grows back on Jan 1 and the doctor has to document the diagnosis again
      * Medicare is either too lazy to discern between permanent vs reversible conditions, and/or they like that they get to pay less for an inaccurately lower risk score
   * When providers forget to include one or more codes, that means the risk score will be lower and the premium received by the MA plan will be lower
   * CLOV's software analyzes data from the EHR as well as past claims to identify diagnosis codes that are missing from the current claim, and asks the provider if they still have the condition to see if the doctor simply forgot to document the code
   * CLOV's software also analyzes EHR and claims data to identify potentially missing diagnosis codes and asks the doctor if the patient ever had a certain condition using evidence-based guidelines  

      * Example: blood pressure reading > 140/90 (threshold in hypertension guidelines) but no hypertension diagnosis code documented

# Why is CLOV Undervalued?

**Part 1: Hindenburg Report (February 2021)**

* Hindenburg does research for short hedge funds. The [report](https://hindenburgresearch.com/clover/) revealed a DOJ investigation into CLOV that was previously undisclosed. The day after the report was released, an SEC investigation was initiated into CLOV based on the report. The report had a number of unrelated claims on shady marketing practices, undisclosed business relationships, and ""upcoding"".
* Probably the most serious accusation of them all is the one about ""upcoding"". If this is true, it's Medicare fraud. The number one rule in the Medicare industry is DON'T OVERBILL MEDICARE. In the case of CLOV, I seriously doubt there is any upcoding going on based on how their software works. The Clover Assistant (CA) software doesn't have the ability to change any codes. It just makes recommendations. The doctor has to manually do it for regulatory *and* patient safety reasons. There are other population health tools out there that do this exact thing. Often times when upcoding is being investigated, it's because the Medicare fee-for-service claims suggest a much lower risk score. However, that's because providers don't document most codes in fee-for-service claims because they don't get paid to spend the extra time. When the patient then enrolls in a MA plan or DC program, all of a sudden [their risk score shoots up](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20170519/NEWS/170519815/doj-s-medicare-advantage-lawsuits-investigations-likely-to-change-insurance-culture) because the MA/DC organization and provider get paid based on risk.
* Regarding the other accusations, [CLOV released a point-by-point response](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000119312521029637/d66346dex991.htm) the day after the report came out. I thought they addressed everything sufficiently. From an investor's perspective, it all comes down to what the DOJ finds. I'd be very surprised if Chamath's counsel and the third-party counsel involved in the SPAC ignored or did not look into illegal practices during due diligence. This was one of Chamath's first SPACs and he knew was launching many more. If you mess up due diligence once, the rest of your SPACs become worthless.
* **Regarding the BS about the CEO Vivek Garripali**, he bought 3 hospitals in bankruptcy and assumed their debt almost 10 years ago. He quickly found out why they were in so much debt. The health insurance companies offer such limited coverage and almost exclusively to high income neighborhoods. So, if their insuree visited a hospital or clinic or anything outside of their coverage area, the insurance company would refuse to pay the hospitals fees or only agree to paying a small portion. So the medical facility ultimately ends up assuming the debt and this eventually snowballs. Anyways. Vivek began charging these insurance companies high premiums on the accounts he could collect on in an attempt to make up for the losses for patients they wouldn't pay for. This is where they try and paint him as a villain. Long story short. He sold the the hospitals and created Clover Health in order to solve this corrupt problem throughout the health insurance industry. For his time and money invested. He didn't make money as much as he learned from this experience. So a big part of Clover's mission is offering widespread coverage to their insurees. These big insurance companies are hating this. Hence much of the hate for Clover.

&#x200B;

**Part 2: DC Enrollment Numbers (May 2021)**

* CLOV announced their initial Direct Contracting (DC) enrollment numbers in their most recent quarterly report. The 65,000 DC patients were far below the 200,000 that the market was expecting. There was obviously a miscommunication between CLOV and the market. CLOV stated they had *access* to 200,000 Medicare patients through their network of 1,800 providers using their software. Analysts took that as a projection of enrollment. They still have access to all those patients and will enroll them over time. My guess is they were able to do [claims-based alignment](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/direct-contracting-summary) for much of the initial 65,000 DC patients, which is automatic. Now they have to market this program to the other $135,000 DC patients to get them enrolled via [voluntary alignment](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/direct-contracting-summary) (i.e. consent). They could also market the MA plan which has more benefits. That's the power of CLOV having a network of providers contracted with its DCE and MA plan.
* This lower DC patient enrollment has now been priced in with analysts adjusting down to an average price target of [$9.33](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CLOV/research-ratings). These price targets are based on extremely conservative enrollment projections and revenue projections from CLOV for their DC business.
* They set forecasts at 70,000 to 100,000 by end of 2021. *They already have 65,000 enrolled in April*. They intentionally set expectations extremely low to absorb the negative market reaction upfront and then outperform going forward. They also reported extremely low revenue projections for the DC patients. They're only projecting [$20M - $30M](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-health-reports-first-quarter-2021-financial-results) for the year.
* I would guess that their **profits** from the DC market this year could be $25M+ (5% margin x 65,000 patients x $850 x 9 months). Revenue should be similar to Medicare Advantage at $850+ per patient per month. That's at least $55M in Medicare payments per month for 65,000 DC patients.
* They did state that ""[GAAP revenue estimates for Direct Contracting are dependent on the finalization of accounting treatment, which we expect will be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2021](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-health-reports-first-quarter-2021-financial-results)"".

**Part 3: Differentiation**

* CLOV does have a virtuous cycle built into its business. It's all based on their relationship with their provider network. When they contract with a healthcare provider, they give them access to the Clover Assistant (CA) for free. CA is a software platform that analyzes electronic health record (EHR) and claims data to provide decision support back to the provider at the point of care.
* The CA platform is a population health tool. There are competing software solutions in the market. The difference here is that the provider has to pay for access to those tools. CLOV pays the provider to use the CA platform. CLOV pays **$200** per visit, which is much higher than the average [$121.45](https://truecostofhealthcare.org/medicare_part_b/) that other MA plans pay.
* The reason that CLOV pays the provider to use it is because it improves the top and bottom line for CLOV. CA helps providers make better treatment decisions and document risk scores more accurately, which results in higher Medicare payments (to CLOV and the provider). Higher Medicare payments directly increases the top line revenue. Better treatment decisions lead to lower costs, which allows CLOV (MA plan or DCE) to keep more Medicare dollars. If you're interested in how CA works, I'll include some bulletpoints at the bottom of the post.
* **Happy providers are key to increasing the number of lives managed long term.** Providers are directly involved in the ""alignment"" process for DC enrollment, and their opinion is highly respected when making a recommendation around which MA plan a patient should choose. As CLOV grows its provider network, it will increase enrollment for both MA and DC. It will also lead to more CA software users, more software users usually leads to better experience and insights, which could reinforce itself and bring more providers onboard.

# Risks to CLOV

Below are the biggest risks I see for CLOV, in order of importance:

**1.** **DOJ Investigation**

As I mentioned above, I don't think there were illegal practices going on at CLOV that management, Chamath, or the third-party counsel were aware of. It's still possible the DOJ investigation finds something. This happens all the time in the Medicare industry, including to the biggest names ([UnitedHealth, Humana,](https://www.whistleblowerattorneys.com/blog/whistleblower-unitedhealth-medicare-advantage-fraud) [Cigna](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/doj-cigna-medicare-advantage-fraud-lawsuit/583023/), etc.).

All the MA plans learn from each other's missteps. CLOV has been operating an MA plan for over 5 years now. They were [fined $106,095 in 2016](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payer/cms-fines-clover-health-for-misleading-marketing-tactics) for 'misleading' marketing tactics. *They haven't been fined since*. They have also gone through multiple rounds of funding from top venture capitalists and Google. There's been no shortage of due diligence on this company.

Yet, there is always the risk that someone somewhere was doing something illegal this time. If that is the case, it will likely end up in a lawsuit. I've seen many cases get to this stage and then get dismissed by a federal judge ([UnitedHealth 1](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/antifraud/unitedhealthcare-medicare-advantage-fraud-suit-department-justice), [UnitedHealth 2](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payer/department-justice-unitedhealth-medicare-advantage-fraud), ). Worst case scenario for the company, there is a settlement. Here are examples of MA plans paying settlements for ""upcoding"" fraud cases:

* UnitedHealth (2017): [$32M](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/antifraud/florida-insurers-pay-32m-to-settle-medicare-advantage-fraud-case)
* Kaiser Permanente (2020): [$6.3M](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/medicare-advantage-provider-pay-63-million-settle-false-claims-act-allegations)
* Humana (2021): [$12.5M](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/payer-issues/humana-roche-settle-false-claims-lawsuit-for-12-5m.html)

The largest settlement ever was [$270M](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/medicare-advantage-provider-pay-270-million-settle-false-claims-act-liabilities) by HealthCare Partners (now part of UnitedHealth) in 2018. This was because the providers themselves were submitting false codes (not the health plan). All of these settlements are for ""upcoding"". Again, among all the accusations, I would be most surprised if CLOV was actually doing this. If anything, the Clover Assistant should result in better documentation around the codes because that's what it's designed to do.

No matter how cynical a view you want to take on the DOJ investigation, CLOV has no debt and $700M in cash from the SPAC proceeds, so a settlement should not significantly impact them.

**2.** **SEC Investigation**

The SEC investigation was announced the day after the Hindenburg report came out. The SEC is investigating whether the DOJ inquiries were material enough to require disclosure to the market. The investigation may not be closed until the DOJ inquiries have been resolved. If the SEC determines there should have been a disclosure, there will likely be a fine. I'm not an expert on SEC enforcement. The only thing I could point to would be the $20M fine Elon Musk paid for announcing a fake acquisition at a much higher price at the time. He picked $420 as the fake number, not sure why...

**3. Market Multiple**

Valuations based on profitability could be hurt in the short term. Medical costs are higher this year due to delayed care during COVID-19, so all companies in this space will have compressed margins in the short-term. I believe growth is more important than profitability in this market when you're looking at <1% of DC patients enrolled. CLOV has proven to be exceptional at growth and has proven it both in MA and now DC.

There could also be a general downturn in market sentiment, and these growth stocks with low margins would be affected the most. However, Medicare is a very stable business and these companies will continue to grow independent of economic conditions.

# Current Technical Analysis (unbiased)

There are several **bullish indicators**, however we must not discard the **bearish signals** that may bring about a short term reversal for CLOV. If a reversal does occur, at least we know that we are prepared for it, instead of being taken by surprise. But again, the bullish indicators may very well prevail. We simply **need good volume** to keep pushing.

&#x200B;

[3 Month Chart](https://preview.redd.it/um9bgnnmrp371.png?width=1385&format=png&auto=webp&s=50c28ccc2e414cfe632ec9e02f27a0bed05ab4d1)

On the above chart, we see price action testing and re-testing Fibonacci key levels during the last 3 month period with successes and failures. We are now at a fork where the price may bounce off and reclaim higher levels, or breach thru and re-test lower levels. No one can pretend to know with certainty which direction will tug harder.

&#x200B;

[3 Month Cup and Handle](https://preview.redd.it/vwnw4epnrp371.png?width=1382&format=png&auto=webp&s=380e0274bd5ae0f72d8a8da281d3c3308ee5302a)

Above is the 3-month period where a very clear cup and handle pattern has formed. This is [normally a bullish signal.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cupandhandle.asp)

&#x200B;

[1 Month Cup & Handle](https://preview.redd.it/68sgv5qorp371.png?width=1384&format=png&auto=webp&s=13c1cde47d3f4bba53a404545aac466d8a29d372)

Above is the same cup and handle pattern, but on the 1-month chart.

&#x200B;

[15 day chart - 11$ target](https://preview.redd.it/bypsajpprp371.png?width=1381&format=png&auto=webp&s=c79ee05682fc83d1b1109146325945b50fb13f10)

On the 15-day chart, an uptrend was formed with higher highs and higher lows. Price kept bouncing off the trend line to finally break out and trade sideways for several days. Another breakout occurred and we are now at the fork. A triangle pattern can be displayed, but it is unclear whether it is a bullish or a bearish pattern. Depending on how you wish to look at it, the price can break thru in any direction. Add to that the Fibonacci levels, and we have ourselves a Mexican standoff.

&#x200B;

[5 day chart](https://preview.redd.it/zi0ltovqrp371.png?width=1383&format=png&auto=webp&s=b326b85e59765f7623714391c9cd2936a577c189)

Finally, on the 5-day chart, if the price fails to bounce off both the 61.8% and 50% Fibonacci price zones, then we may enter a new downtrend.

&#x200B;

* **In the end, volume and catalysts may keep the bullish trend alive much longer, even if minor pullbacks occur.**  
* **We need to Hold 9$ this week in order to break through $10.50**
* **Short sellers are underwater at 11$ so they are trying hard to prevent this**
* **epic squeeze could happen if we break 11$**
* **Do the shorts really not think insiders would like to see 30$ before they can sell anything?  Apparently the CEO is never getting paid for any of this lol.**

# The Meme-Stock Correlation, Short Interest, and Gamma Squeeze setup

To keep this short and sweet - CLOV was originally identified by WSB & Stocktwitters for the short interest being reported over 100% at one point.  This is due to several miscalculations but the idea is true that SI is not being correctly reported.  It is estimated to be over 50% but is reported around 40% on Ortex.  This has been the main area of interest in relation to meme stocks.

# How did CLOV get caught up in all the meme madness?  

Well..  if you dont remember, back in January, chamath palihapitiya encouraged retail investors, along with elon musk, to buy and SQUEEZE GME + AMC.  

[GME squeezes from 60 to over 150 the next day on this Tweet](https://preview.redd.it/quoosh9nup371.png?width=1176&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a0b3d8969d37920eee6947d97ac8585eaea345d)

[but this helped too](https://preview.redd.it/qucv5j9tup371.png?width=1182&format=png&auto=webp&s=88e306406085ab9fc59d787bd3ab2381a52df689)

He made himself an enemy of hedgefunds who lost on these bets.  So when they doubled down their shorts on gme / amc - they went after chammaths stock, CLOV.  But they fucked up.  They doubled down and shorted it to shit because they lost money because of him.  

With great fundamentals, **the short thesis is based on one thing alone - the HindenTurd report -** and guess what that is?  bullshit.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Did you mention Gamma Squeeze??

yes I did.   I even googled it for you apes.

[so basically, the amount of OPEN INTEREST on each STRIKE in the CALL OPTIONS CHAIN tells us how many shares market makers need to buy in order to hedge when an option goes IN THE MONEY.](https://preview.redd.it/9xwx5eusvp371.png?width=922&format=png&auto=webp&s=a249f7e92d29af0518dddff6cb7079788f1c88c8)

So basically, look at the **open interest** on each Strike.  Each new strike that goes in the money has to get hedged.  So basically multiply the open interest x 100 for each strike. 

&#x200B;

[if we can get the 10$ strike ITM, it should start a domino effect especially during a month that requires this many shares be bought for the Russell 2000 index.  Imagine if they had to buy in at over 15$...](https://preview.redd.it/is8dlv9ewp371.png?width=1576&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8053c02d47b4b92c351b11b47875a53adb94cd9)

* Is a Gamma Squeeze possible?  
   * Yes.  
* is a Short Squeeze possible?  
   * Yes.
* Will either of the above happen?
   * IDK.  

&#x200B;

* Will CLOV get to 30$ regardless of these 2 things?
   * Yes.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------

# TLDR:

* Clover Health is basically Medicare insurance for old people meets AI tech (the clover assistant for doctors) it’s a huge healthcare disruptor. 
* They have 45+% year over year growth, zero debt, 700 mill in cash, 100%+ institutional ownership.. \*\*\*They basically make money everytime someone gets old & then doctors use their clover assistant to connect data in more efficient ways to save costs and improve outcomes…
* Fair value is 15$ but insiders and CEO can’t sell till 30$ for 90 days. So 30$ IS EXPECTED. and chammath said it’s a 10x in 10 years company.
* Chelsea Clinton is on the board + the former trump head of Medicare, google is invested and a partner. President is ex google engineer Andrew toy. 
* Got Spaccd to the public by Chamath & shorted to oblivion by Hindenburg & short sellers who attacked this one in particular because he encouraged amc / gme .. short interest is likely above 50% and it seems to have a gamma squeeze setup in the options chain.
* The short thesis is based on the Hindenburg report which is based on what can be found inside my asshole.
* It’s a completely legit, solid growth / healthcare / tech & Medicare insurance company.
* \*\*Also a WSB legend [u/SIR\_JACK\_A\_LOT](https://www.reddit.com/u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT/) has 2 million all in on CLOV bitches

# CATALYSTS FOR PRICE ACTION:

* June 25. Russell 2000 index inclusion, will force 70 million in shares purchased for ETF's that track it.
* further discussion of reduced Medicare age or related
* public announcement Clearing of the DOJ / SEC inquiries.. ***this ones HUGE for fucking up the short thesis at its core...***
* future earnings & enrollment #’s, (every time they beat numbers will be great...)
* clover assistant updates
* I’m sure other things like great PR will eventually come out hopefully more from Chamath and the Clinton.

26,26,"No AMC or BB holders should be wearing pants and here's the analysis to prove it Like all of you, I was fascinated by Adam Aron's bold strategy to not wear pants in a [Zoom interview](https://www.crossingbroad.com/2021/06/adam-aron-did-not-appear-to-be-wearing-pants-on-this-zoom-call.html) last week. However, I was even more fascinated by the correlation between Aron's refusal to wear pants and the price of AMC. As you can see in my red crayon analysis below, Thursday saw a deep AMC dive, but quickly rebounded after Aron's daring refusal to wear pants during his interview. As a result of Aron's fearless leadership, tendies soared, and it rained diamonds. Of course, paper handed bitches  immediately started denying that Aron was pantsless, causing fear and doubt among the lesser apes, and AMC dropped on Friday.

But all this no pants business got me thinking. What about ***MY*** pants? If Aron's no pants correlation is true for AMC, is it also true for BB? Luckily, I hadn't yet eaten all of my red crayons, allowing me to do another deep dive into BB, which is also posted below. As any true smooth brainer can see, there is an obvious correlation between whether I had pants on and the price of BB. I was WFH on Tuesday and Wednesday, so obviously I refused to wear pants, and BB soared as a result. However, my batshit crazy boss made me come in for a half day on Thursday, and I had to wear pants for some of that day, resulting in pants confusion and a volatile BB market. Friday was terrible, as I had to return to the office for the ENTIRE day, resulting in horrible losses for BB.

The conclusion of my analysis is clear guys. DO NOT WEAR PANTS next week. If your boss won't let you WFH, then quit and go work for your wife's boyfriend.

TL/DR: **DO NOT WEAR PANTS THIS WEEK YOU RETARDS**

28,28,"$AMC and $GME Are Going To Cycle through Dips And Peaks This Year. Both stocks are a battleground in the war between retail and institutional investors.  The reason why there will be a lot of money made against short sellers this year is due to what the actual outcome of this battle means.  The battle is who gets to control the narrative in the market.  That's far more valuable than the actual fundamentals in any of these investments.  The value of both these stocks now balances on the fact they are ""battleground stocks.""

AMC and GME were slated to be windfalls for short sellers and predatory investors.  Major Hedge Funds keep taking stupid losses on these stocks because they need to be right.  If they aren't right then the narrative is broken.  So they can't continue a cycle of targeting stocks they want to crash and profiting off the panic they generate.  If retail dictates the narrative then being able to short sell a stock down to nothing becomes a lot harder.  Analysts actually have to study companies intensively and follow market sentiment rather than justifying their sentiment and engineering the falling share price.

So yeah I would hold forever.  Because maybe you FOMO this time around and end up holding the bag.  But we have seen several spikes this year, so next go around you find yourself profiting.  We have seen multiple billion dollar losses reported by hedge funds.  It's easy to suggest that these funds are coming back in to closely watched stocks, trying to short and getting caught.  So we see squeezes and general excitement over serious money being on the wrong side of these stocks.

So not a financial adviser, just a retard.  But yeah I'd hang in, buy during dips and hold until you're happy to profit.  We are going to see AMC and GME fought over all year because the precious narrative is at stake."
29,29,"I built a program that tracks mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter! This week's most discussed and top growing stocks! This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. I have also added the Week-on-Week stock price change due to popular requests. 

Overall, it has been an amazing week for investors in general and all the top growing stocks that [I shared here last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/noc6r0/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) have ended in green with an average return of 11.7%. So, without further ado, let's dive into this week’s list! 

 **Most Discussed Stocks of the Week** 

https://preview.redd.it/per8x892fn371.png?width=1039&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d457b0954852cb8d3abacf10341d7dadd99e3d3

Both AMC and BB individually generated more discussion than the other 8 put together! This can be attributed to the possibility of the next squeeze and also the rallying stock price. Weed stocks also made a double entry into the top 10 list with SNDL coming in 4th and TLRY 5th (we will discuss why in the next section). Investors were most bullish about Tilray and Nokia’s prospects as reflected by the sentiment! Another interesting observation is that it has been a rough week for Tesla with it being the only stock in the list that ended in the red.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/ov3zes4cfn371.png?width=1208&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca5d580ccfea58c5659a40b50afec8b78da53666

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. Almost all the stocks increased in chatter due to the rally of meme stocks and not due to any fundamental news

**BlackBerry($BB):** No points for guessing the top growing stock of the week. BlackBerry was also present in the [last week’s list](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/noc6r0/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) and the stock has been running up almost 80% in the last six weeks. The discussions were predominantly driven around whether BB would be the next short squeeze play. Even though the company has made some significant strides over the last year (Collaboration with AWS being an example), there are no specific news that’s driving the current rally.

**Clean Energy Fuels($CLNE):** There isn’t any new fundamental news out of the company for the current rally but the discussion exploded in Reddit and the stock gained as much as 20% on Thursday. The stock experienced a quadrupling of the average daily volume as Reddit investors piled on to the stock. The company is still trading at a healthy 17.6% increase over last week’s closing price.

**Workhorse Group($WKHS):** Even though the company did not have a good month in May with them disappointing the investors with their first-quarter results (the company only delivered six electric cargo trucks). But the shares of the company have rocketed more than 40% in June. The discussion volume as well as the trading volume has been on a consistent rise over the past week.  

**Nokia($NOK):** Nokia’s current rally is primarily driven by optimism over its back-to-back 5G network deployment wins with multiple telecom operators such as Net4Mobility, DITO Telecommunity Corporation, T-Mobile, and Optus. The company has also resolved a long-drawn patent licensing dispute with Daimler and has been strengthening its financials by generating strong cash flows. Investor sentiment has also been extremely bullish as we can see from the trends.

**Sundial Growers($SNDL):** Weed stocks are mainly moving due to a mix of fundamental news and retail trading interest. SNDL rose almost 30% this week before dropping down. The marijuana industry is consolidating and a spate of deals were announced this week. Adding to this, there has been progress in legalization efforts in the US. Tilray(TLRY) has also been on the run with the stock price increasing 12% and the chatter growing by 300% this week.

**Honorable Mentions:** AMC Entertainment($AMC) chatter grew by 189% (which is massive considering that the stock was already the [most discussed stock last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/noc6r0/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/)) and Clover Health ($CLOV) discussions increased by 255% but were not high enough to make the top 5 list.

31,31,"Another good, clean 🚀🌙 DD... Let's review some discussion and thoughts about our wives' newest bf... Mr. $CLNE Hello again WSB,

Are you enjoying a weekend of recovery from an unfortunate (read: 100% normal) week of buying high and selling low? WELL, same here. Now that I'm awake from that Friday night bender (it's Sunday?), I wanted to take a few minutes to do a couple of things....

1. TL;DR at the bottom, but I do hope you take a second to skim it
2. Review some analyst predictions and price targets on CLNE
3. Talk to you about CLNE short activity that has taken place over the last couple of days
4. Update the room on the status of market conditions surrounding CLNE and just some sentiment

If you want to learn more about CLNE, I've got a short DD post in my history from last week that you can check out; it's an easy read. Or, recommended, you can search for one of the more in depth DD's done here; all great work.

^(Disclaimers:) 

^(1. no images because auto-mod kept screwing me last time.  - 2. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. - 3. 1,000 shares at <$8.25 average dating back to first purchase in 2020.  - 4. Thank you mom for turning my computer on and transcribing my incoherent mumbling into these words.)

# Let's start with a review of analyst price targets... CLNE closed Friday at $9.31

* 5 analysts have offered 12 month price targets on CLNE
* Low estimate is $11.00 (18.2% gain from Friday close)
* High estimate is $27.00 (190% gain from Friday close)
* Median estimate is $20.00 (114.8% gain from Friday close)
* **Cramer came out in May and said he doesn't like the stock**

""aNaLyStS aRe DuMb AnD Ur DuMb ToO"" - I know and I know. ""AnD aMaZoN iS GoNnA dIlUtE tHeM sHaReS bRuThUr!"" What? Ok..... **To quote Bill \[from science videos shown in elementary school class rooms whose last name happens to be the same as a small cap stock ticker\],** ***consider the following...***

* There's a legitimate case to be made for the stock having an extended-term floor of somewhere near $13.49, thanks to details of their partnership with little-known company called Amazon.
* As a part of the deal with Bezos Inc, which also supports 46 CLNE fueling stations, Amazon reserved the right to purchase up to 53 million shares on warrants at a strike price of $13.49.
* *However,* only a quarter of these are exercisable immediately. The rest are only vested after Jeff has made a certain amount of fuel purchases from CLNE. This drastically detracts from the cost of the deal, and the way CLNE runs those sales/revenues will most certainly be pumped back into additional infrastructure investment (see their earnings which are always dead on estimates and near $0.00 EPS)
* In short, Amazon has a huge stake pending in CLNE, but only after significant additional expenditure and investment. AKA..... *PARTNERSHIP*

# Moving on to the topic of... shorts and activity...

I'm not as fluent on this subject as I am some others like technical mumbo jumbo and early 2000's pop-punk/emo music (IT'S NOT A PHASE MOM), but I think you'll appreciate the information here and at least be able to connect the dots as to how this relates to the other popular stonk plays on this sub.

* Over the last 10 trading days, before Thursday/Friday, daily shares sold short sits at about 10% of volume.
* On Thursday this rose to 26.8% on the day - on Friday again to 32% on the day
* So what, 26 or 32% isn't huge, right? Sort of.
* The significance from the rise in ratio of shares sold short vs volume is the **concurrent spike in volume.... In terms of absolute numbers, shares sold short went from about 500,000 per day to 8.10 million on Thursday and 10.64 million on Friday.**
* The major short players on this stock have been Citadel and Blackstone.
* Spoiler alert.... **According to fintel, short shares availability is only 8.6 million as of June 4th.**
* With an average daily volume of around 5 million (again, before Thursday/Friday), how many days to cover....? You do the math.

# And some final thoughts about market conditions around CLNE and the options landscape...

I'm not here to push any squeeze thesis, just providing information to help you develop your own conclusions about what I believe to be a great stock play (I've been in since 2020). There is short and long term potential here, in my opinion.

* The \[now famous\] June 18th $13 strike call OI now sits at 29,544, an increase of about 25% since my last update and representing 2.95 million shares of exercisable calls. This is about 60% of the average daily volume prior to the spike in volume on Thursday/Friday.
* A reddit user, who I won't name because I haven't asked them, who used to work in IR at CLNE indicated to me during chat/discussion this weekend that the leadership team is aware of the recent uptick in interest/sentiment and are excited that people are not only interested in the company, but also believe in the product.
* The DD content and general sentiment on here the last couple of days, and months honestly, has been positive. The environmental side of the story is great. Besides needing a decent business case and technicals, never before in history (my opinion) has it been more important to have a good story/mission to make people feel good about what your company is doing. Our society is more social than ever.
* **🐄💨🚀** 🌙

TL;DR

Do I think this is a one-way ticket to \[the planet\] Uranus? No. Do I think this will make me an overnight millionaire? No, especially because my position is relatively small. But, I do think that there is a legitimate shot at some gains both short and long term here. **The company has a product, sales, partnerships, a good story, and now the backing of an army of passionate people (read: apes) who, quite simply, like the stock.**

Thanks and take care.

34,34,"ACADEMY & THOR Tues Earnings Thoughts on the earnings call on Tuesday for Tho and ASO. After launching it's IPO in October ASO has been on a tear and it's competitor Dicks trades at 80+ a share. I really believe ASO is WAAAAY WAAAAAAAAAAAAY undervalued. I live in Texas where Academy is the ""Go to"" for sporting goods and having watched the lines of 100+ people at 7am waiting for ammunition outside I believe it's going to have a big move on Tuesday after beating earnings. 

Thor- They are the Ford+GM+FCA combined of the RV world. They make over a dozen different brands and are represented all over the place. The shortage of supplied and material in 2020 seems to be overcome as units are back on the lots now and demand has never been higher. 

I think both of these are set to move this week with both of them substantially beating their earnings. 

And ASO being a long term play that's got a lot of value to it over the next 2 years. I see it trading at the level of Dicks after a year of crushing earnings calls. 

Thoughts?"
35,35,"ASO: Not a meme stock ASO has earnings tomorrow premarket, and it's supremely undervalued compared to S&P 500 and its industry competitors, despite its impressive run up. I'll let the images below speak for themselves.

Why is ASO bullish: Primarily guns and ammo still.

Position: 150 shares, short 40$ put expiring this month, long 40$ call expiring December.

36,36,"Let's get ready for Moo-nday! Let's review why cow farts are the smartest short and long term play on the market ahead of Moo-nday (bullet points for busy apes) :

* Recycled natural gas (RNG) is the future of green commercial long distance transportation and is years ahead of it's competitors in terms of technology and infrastructure (hydrogen/electric). RNG allows for negative emissions and is extremely cost effective.
* Clean Energy ($CLNE) is an established RNG provider with little to no competition. They own most of the infrastructure and the only reason they're not reporting profits quarter after quarter is because they're just building more, prioritizing growth over short term profits.
* $CLNE just secured massive deals with Amazon (heard of them?) and Chevron, paving the way for universal industry adoption.
* The fact that the technology is so misunderstood by Wallstreet has created a tremendous opportunity for early investors.
* PRICE : Even with some of you readers realizing the stock's potential last week, the current price (9.59$ AH) is sitting at a HUGE discount from it's intrinsic value as well as from Amazon's optional buy-in price of 13$. A large number of analysts have openly supported this by setting EOY targets ranging from 11$ (extremely conservative) to 27$ (3x).
* Why does this matter? This means your potential downside of buying at 9.59$ is AT WORST the 15% gained from it's established support at 7.5$ while your potential upside is SIGNIFICANT. As a shareholder, I personally do not see a reason to sell this stock even if the short term scenario (detailed below) plays out because there are few other growth stocks which match it's mid-term potential. Compare this with the possible downside of other meme stocks before making a decision.
* POTENTIAL SHORT TERM PLAY : So if you've read my previous DD as well as the DDs of fellow cow fart enthusiasts, the open interest on the June 18th 13c is a whopping 29,000 with significant open interest on the strikes before and after up to the 20c. As the price approaches 13$, the option sellers who have sold their calls naked are forced to buy shares, driving the price higher. In return, considering the stock has been heavily shorted by Citadel, Blackstone and the like in the past few weeks, this puts short sellers in a precarious situation, especially as we go above 11$. All this, combined with a low market cap (small purchase = big effect), leads to an explosive cocktail. The potential for a gamma and subsequent short squeeze is only the cherry on top for one the best growth stocks in green energy.

So in the end, we have a stock with :

1. Extremely limited downside, significant upside (buy low, sell high)
2. Long and short term gain potential
3. Unparalleled potential for growth
4. Little to no competition in it's field
5. Established partnerships with some of the biggest enterprises in the US
6. And for those of you like me who care for the environment, brownie points for saving the planet in an innovative and cost efficient way (getting rich while preserving nature? yes please!)

Need I say more? This stock will make you feel like Warren Buffet, a silverback ape and Captain Planet at the same fucking time.

The jist of it is that in 1918, a man has 10 ounces of gold.  For this example below, we want to look at real purchasing power, not inflation , so while 10 ounces of gold would have cost $200 in 1918, we are going to say it cost him $20,000.

If he had held the 10 ounces of gold from 1918 until today, our original 10 ounces of gold would now be worth $20,000.  There is no gain from only holding gold.  In this scenario it is a shiny rock.  (we know that if he held cash, he would have LOST $19,800 purchasing power)

By comparison, an equal and simple $20,000 ""buy-and-hold"" investment indexed to the Dow from 1918 to 2018, with dividend reinvested, would have yielded an annual return of 10.44%  The gain on this trade would have been $4.26 million.  The total return was 21,200%

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\----------------------------------------TRADING THE DOW GOLD RATIO ------------------------

&#x200B;

Using $20,000 and trading the Dow/Gold ratio, we end up with $8.4 million a century later. That's a 41,000% return, or double the above investment.  (a forty one thousand percent return of real purchasing power)  I know some of you might be able to throw 100k at this - it seems like a pretty easy way to make 40 million.  Or just use 20k of your 100k to get to 8 million.  Is this BAD advice?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As we saw in the first example, just holding the shiny rock didn’t provide any return, it only protected against inflation.

&#x200B;

HOWEVER, if gold or silver were merely inflation hedges, they would actually follow inflation, right?  They would follow the money supply or any other stable number.  You wouldn't have these wild swings.

https://preview.redd.it/6hnk6iyvvr371.jpg?width=1828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d6b52920640c943cbd3ac04663f8353b53f781f7

&#x200B;

Another way to look at this is ff you bought gold in 1980 for $800 an ounce, and then sold it in 2000 for $300 an ounce, you would have actually LOST money.  During this time the CPI and cost of everything didn’t go down, it went up.  So gold should have risen.  It would NOT have performed as an inflation hedge.

&#x200B;

This tells us that if we buy at the wrong time, we lose money.  However, if we buy at the RIGHT time, we have huge gains.  And when we combine that with buying stocks when they are cheap (not right now, although the Dow could hit 40,000 in a melt UP) we get massive gains.

&#x200B;

41,000% of REAL purchasing power gains.  Again, this is not inflation adjusted, if so it would have been a 4 million percent return.

&#x200B;

If you buy gold at the right time, you actually do gain purchasing power, and more importantly, you don’t lose during most stock market corrections.  Then you buy the cheap stocks and hold them while they go up.

&#x200B;

Even if you are not on board with this, think about making 10% of your portfolio gold, silver, or computer money, whatever you think is stable and won't lose.  For gold, you only have to look at what every central bank is doing. (except Canada, lol)  Use the amazing power of the internet to see what China and Russia are doing with gold right now.

&#x200B;

For silver – well – you literally have silver in your hand right now.  It’s used in electronics and solar panels.  70% of silver is used by industry, so it’s definitely not just a shiny rock.  It’s actually a critical metal that will be in short supply for the rest of our lives.  In 2100, there will actually not be any more silver in the ground to mine.

&#x200B;

I don’t know about computer money.  I am not big on real estate right now…because it’s in a bubble.  I think that if you have 100k and you buy silver, that will increase to 500k!  And then you can sell it for cheap stocks or then buy a house.  Again, look at the above charts.  Silver and gold have massive swings during these bubble pops and stock market corrections. 

&#x200B;

If you bought a house for 100k, I think that bubble will pop and you will lose 80k – you will be underwater on your mortgage because it’s only worth 20k.  When this bubble pops, how many 20k houses could you have bought with the 500k of silver?  Twenty five?

&#x200B;

This would be similar to trading the Dow/Gold ratio.  The silver/real estate ratio.  It really does look like most things are in a bubble.  This might expand before popping, or who knows, it might never pop again.

41,41,"Which Company Has the Best Chance to Create It's Own Short Squeeze (list)  

I wanted to figure out **which among the most shorted stocks have the highest potential to create a spontaneous squeeze.** In other words, a squeeze that will occur as a result of the stock price going up quite simply as a result of the performance of the company.

So, to clarify: the better the point total of the company, the larger is its potential to see a spike in stock price based on performance alone, to the point that the price surge will create a squeeze.

**To create the list** I went with the most shorted stocks with a market cap above 2 bil. I didn't want to include smaller companies because then volatility and manipulation become hard to calculate.

Then **I used several different parameters** to include in the point total, including: short percentage, revenue, earnings, target price, float, insider and institutional ownership, groundbreaking news generation, current/ytd/52 high and low prices, etc...

I then proceeded to give each parameter value. One was **total value**, meaning how relevant is that parameter to the issue at hand: potential stock rise. The other was **relative value**, meaning, how much better is one company doing in comparison to all the others in the list. That is how values were awarded to reach a total, that I named **NSQP (natural squeeze potential).**

**Generally speaking, I liked the results**, meaning, I think the list makes sense, although I haven't gone through it one by one to evaluate how accurate it seems to be. But I think it does shed light on what companies are least likely to create their own squeeze and which companies have strong squeeze potential. In fact, I think anyone shorting the top five in this list is de-facto insane.

**Comments, questions and bashing are welcome**. I have a position in Sorrento (that came in first), and that position was what got me thinking about creating the list to begin with. I was curious to know how SRNE would fare compared to other shorted companies. I absolutely do not think I manipulated the list, because when I was doing it, I had no way of knowing what the final result would be. Too many numbers....

49,49,"Explaining Days-To-Cover for Apes This is a new account: I switched from my old account so I could make anonymous comments about Megan Markles feet and not get found out by my wifes bf (hi Chad).

**What Is Days To Cover?**

2021 has brought about lots of gains and losses , new investors, and new language to the game. One of these terms is ""Days-To-Cover"".

Days to cover is related to the short ratio as a measure of short interest in a stock. DTC is calculated by taking the quantity of shares that are currently sold short and dividing that amount by the stock's average daily trading volume. For example, if hedge fund 🌈🐻s have shorted 2 million shares of $TENDIES, and the average volume is 1 million, then days to cover is 2.0.

**So Who Cares? Why Is It So Important?**

DTC can serve as a signal on how bearish or bullish traders are about a company. A high days-to-cover ratio might be a signal that company performance is shit.

It also gives investors an idea of potential future buying pressure. In the event of a rally in the stock, 🌈🐻s have to buy back shares on the open market to close out their positions. Obviously they'll try to buy back the shares for the lowest price possible. But since they have created a higher demand for shares, this will drive up the price. Since the price is higher, they need to close out even more of their positon.... which drives the price higher, and so on.

Also, a high days-to-cover ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze. This information can benefit a trader looking to make a quick profit by buying that company's shares ahead of the anticipated event actually coming to fruition.

TL;DR: high days-to-cover = 🌈🐻s being assholes, more likely for $TENDIES going to the moon

For about 12 years Freddie Mac & Fanny Mae have been under a conservatorship. This conservatorship was arguably illegally forced onto the company. Currently the Supreme Court owes a opinion in June that will either free Freddie and Fannie of the conservatorship and able to profit. Or of course it could stay a two dollar stock the way it has been for the last 12 years. If the company is free the pre-conservatorship stock price was about $80 a share back in 2007. I could only imagine what the company could be worth now. Last year both companies profited about $30 billion total. That is a lot of margin. That is a ton of profit for such a small company (total employees). All of this money has been swept into the government and has been paying for Obamacare since it started in 2008. The upside is enormous. Can you imagine investing in a two dollar stock with the upside of 80+ dollars per share? Yes the downside is about two dollars or potentially less if the Supreme Court decides to keep the net worth sweep legal. Do your homework. This could be a life changer. I’m swinging for the fences on this one. This is going to be my home run. This has been going on for about 12 years. We are in the ninth inning of the ball game.

This stock could be your ride or die, and TELL is the kind of partner that will have hot 🍗tendies on the table when you get 🏡 .

🐒Fun Fact: Did you know Liquid Natural Gas is used as Rocket Fuel? Well it is, and that is super neat!!!


 A quick re-cap on 🚀TELL
———————————-
“Tellurian Inc (TELL) is a liquefied natural gas (LNG) development company headquartered in Houston, TX. TELL plans to develop a 27.6 mtpa LNG terminal with five plants near Lake Charles, LA, as well as upstream assets and pipeline infrastructure. The initial stage will likely include 3 plants (16.6 mtpa capacity). The Driftwood project will be financed by equity customers/partners as well as project debt financing. Tellurian will own 28%-42% of Driftwood Holdings and 100% of Tellurian Marketing.""

Tellurian is a market disruptor with their proposed Driftwood Project, which will make them the first end-to-end (well for the production company, pipeline network for transportation, terminal LNG for exporting) exporter with an at-cost LNG acquisition independent of domestic Henry Hub (HH) as they'll be selling primarily on Japanese Korean Marker (JKM) at this time. 
——U/V3capitol

 🤔What is this 🪵Driftwood🪵???

Essentially it is a pipeline, some of you may have heard of the Deals that have been signed recently(I will get back to these later) the Driftwood Pipeline is the vehicle that supplies these deals. The Driftwood Dream has been going since 2016, it would seem we are on the cusp of making that dream a reality. 
This summer we should be seeing some press release on infrastructure build out related to the actual pipeline 🏗 construction 🚧🦺 . Q1 2022 is the projected date for FID and when the pipes might be laid😉

Driftwood has permits, the company(Betchel) to build it, and a team that has done it before. Shovel Ready is the term here

When the construction starts the floodgates will be open and this stock will 🚀🌙. Reference a stock like Cheniere(trading @ 87.35), a company Charif Souki used to work for, so you can get an idea. Speaking of Charif Souki let’s take a peak at the team.

———————————

🌟🌟**All-Star Management**🌟🌟

Tellurian has 2 of 3  pioneer LNG founders that developed the largest Natural Gas companies.

Charif Souki - Chairman - LNG Godfather and Legend, who was the founder of Cheniere Energy in 1996. If they can do it once, they can do it again.

Octávio M.C Simoes - CEO - ""Previously, he was President and CEO of Sempra LNG &amp; Midstream where he was responsible for all LNG and natural gas midstream activities in Sempra’s efforts to develop, build and operate liquefied natural gas (LNG) receipt terminals, liquefaction facilities, natural gas pipelines and storage facilities.""

This team can and will get it ✅

 
🐒Fun Fact # 2 : So you don’t think LNG is cool? 

Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is natural gas that has been cooled to a liquid state, at about -260° Fahrenheit( now that is pretty cool❄️if you ask me)for shipping and storage. The volume of natural gas in its liquid state is about 600 times smaller than its volume in its gaseous state. This process makes it possible to transport natural gas to places pipelines do not reach.




The Deals📑💸

Right now TELL💥 has  2 👬of them Vitol and Guvnor, each worth 12 Billion💵 over the next 10 years. So 2.4 Billion per year in revenue with these alone. We can expect to hear a couple more deals announced in the next month. 

These deals are what have people so excited for this stock as of late, and rightly so!

I know what your 🤔 thinking, so what!?!🤷🏽‍♀️ “Without that pipeline they will not get any of that money. “

Well to the skeptics🛸🗿🔦 I would ask this: Why would these companies be signing deals without doing their due dilligence? I mean here I am doling out info, and my opinions on this company, but don’t take my word for it. Take the word of the not 1 but 2 companies that are going to dish out billions. 💵💴

🐒Fun Fact #3 : LNG from landfill gas.   LNG can also be derived from landfill gas. At a landfill near Livermore, California, landfill gas converted into LNG is being used as fuel to power trash collection vehicles. The plant can produce up to 13,000 gallons of LNG per day from landfill gas, enough fuel for 300 LNG powered collection trucks across 20 California communities. This technology not only turns waste into a renewable energy source, but it also benefits the environment due to the significant reduction in fuel emissions produced by the garbage truck fleet. (Source: http://EarthandIndustry.com: Article: Developing Clean Fuels from Landfill Gas, Wes Muir, 11/23/10)

62,62,"The Weekly DD - Clover Health (CLOV): Moon or Bust? (Full DD) **Another healthcare company?**

CLOV is a US health insurance company currently specialized in offering Medicare Advantage plans to elderly Americans. As an elderly American seeking healthcare insurance, one of the very first choices presented is whether to go with the federally run Medicare or the privately provided Medicare Advantage (still federally funded though). The difference is as follows:

* Medicare allows the customer to choose what the plan covers. They have Part A (hospital care), Part B (doctor visits and services), and Part D (prescriptions).
* Medicare Advantage is Part C, a pre-packaged plan which bundles together Parts A, B, and (usually) D. Medicare Advantage includes all services that Medicare has plus some.

Medicare Advantage usually makes the process more streamlined and easier. Depending on the plan, it may even be cheaper than Medicare. However, the drawback is a much narrower physician network that’s usually based around a local geography. Thus, if you travel anywhere else, it will be difficult to find in-network physicians for care.

CLOV attempts to innovate in this space with their software platform, Clover Assistant. This is a platform which synthesizes all the data available to healthcare insurance providers to provide better patient outcomes. They do this through several features:

* Evidence-based Protocol: using a data-driven model, the Clover Assistant can provide physicians clinical recommendations based upon the patient’s unique situation (history of disease, allergies, etc.).
* Early Disease Detection: machine learning models can predict potential diseases even when the patient is asymptomatic. It provides a list of what chronic diseases the patient may be at risk for so that the physician can conduct early screening if necessary.
* Quality Gap Closure: surfaces opportunities for additional services that the patient should perform. The physician can take the visit as an opportunity to perform these services or to recommend these specific services to the patient for later.

By doing this, they hope to achieve better early detection and preventative care within their customers which leads to less emergency room visits, less unplanned procedures and prescriptions, and less heart ache (quite literally). All this equates to less *unplanned* *costs* for CLOV and more revenue from their insurance policies. With Medicare advantage plans, the government provides a certain pot of money for covering customer Medicare benefits with certain incentives built in. If all incentives are met and no additional services are needed, then the insurance provider pockets all the remaining money as profit. That’s why CLOV is so focused on decreasing these unplanned costs (and of course, for the people).

**Healthcare - Lacks in appeal**

Medicare is currently only available to those over 65 (though there are proposed regulations to change this which we’ll review later). This is CLOV’s – and other Medicare Advantage providers’ – target demographic. By 2040, adults in the US over the age of 65 is expected to more than **double**, reaching 80 million. Adults age 85+ is expected to **quadruple.** 

https://preview.redd.it/9afneo9olo371.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce2d3c332eee871f02c6e955a409c6011622d981

&#x200B;

Moreover, Americans are living longer which means that Medicare will need to cover more for a longer period. In 2000, the average American male, upon turning 62, could expect to live 19 years longer. In 2040, it is estimated that they will live 22 years longer. This estimate is even higher for females.

This necessitates an expansion of Medicare and Medicare Advantage providers to support America’s aging population. We can see this rapid growth within the national health expenditure (NHE) data that the government releases. In 2019, NHE grew by 4.6% to $3.8T. By 2028, it is expected to grow to **$6.2T.** The largest expenditure for government spending in 2019 was in private health insurance spending which grew 3.7% to **$1.2T** (31% of total NHE). If current spending ratios hold, the 2028 expected spend on private health insurance will be **$1.92T.**

Beyond that, enrollment in Medicare Advantage plans has been growing at faster rate every year since 2005. In 2020, nearly 40% of all Medicare beneficiaries were on a Medicare Advantage plan.

https://preview.redd.it/t4j169dplo371.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=a44f4e56483385721f4b034c285d513246c51d20

&#x200B;

Currently, this industry is dominated by a small number of players with three firms making up over 50% of all Medicare Advantage plan offerings.

* UnitedHealth Group serves \~6.5M people.
* Humana serves \~4M people.
* BCBS serves \~2.5M people.

https://preview.redd.it/b89k1msqlo371.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=09f05df9cad06d0d473366ad04eb8028470c3942

Furthermore, competition is fierce within this space with premiums on plans slowly declining since 2015.

https://preview.redd.it/fvj0s8cslo371.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=b011e630db50b7008e6f2006b9444e369f69362c

&#x200B;

Medicare Advantage plans has become increasingly popular from standard Medicare plans. This trend is observed in every state in the US. The increasing popularity of Medicare Advantage plans is most pronounced in for-profit plans which now account for 71% of all enrollees in 2021. Market emergent players (venture-backed players) accounted for \~240,000 enrollees (\~1% of the national enrollees) which is the largest amount it has ever accounted for.

https://preview.redd.it/zr2ys39tlo371.png?width=868&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2d6d1654276df35b2cc1759ff4b8c812b2797db

In general, healthcare is growing rapidly to keep pace with US’ aging population. Medicare Advantage specifically is growing even faster as it remains highly competitive compared to Medicare. However, as big players wrestle for market share, premiums decline, and profits become more difficult to capture. It is a lucrative market for share but crowded and highly competitive.

**Small fish, big sea**

CLOV is attempting to carve a piece of this market out for themselves. They are a smaller local provider operating in 8 states: Arizona, Georgia, Mississippi, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas. CLOV is one of the nation’s fastest growing insurers capturing \~50% of the net increase in membership across its established markets over the previous three years.

https://preview.redd.it/r6qdc7kulo371.png?width=1190&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e474994dead07b53f86c73ddd628ea4c96e40b0

&#x200B;

They currently serve more than 57,000 members across 34 counties. However, is this growth scalable? Proponents of CLOV believe they can do this. And certainly CLOV is tripling its footprint, expanding out to 74 new counties. Whether this translates to similar levels of growth within these counties is yet to be seen. While capturing 50% of the growth within a county is impressive, they are operating only with a network of less than 60,000 members.

Remember, UnitedHealth Group serves over 6M members. I can’t conclude one way or another if this growth is scalable, but certainly it will become harder and more competitive to scale as they continue growing.

They’re primary moat is in Clover Assistant. However, AI in healthcare is not a new concept. In fact **95%** of health care executes are looking to hire business and analytics staff with experience developing AI. 59% of these executives expect a positive return on the investments they have *already* made in AI. Whereas the scope of their AI may be different than CLOV’s, it is hard to argue that CLOV will be able to maintain a moat when they have access to the same data and technology as their competitors (and even less of it since they have less than 60,000 members).

Furthermore, Hindenberg Research released a damning short report for CLOV. While many of the points raised were addressed by CLOV, some, I still consider legitimate and should worry all potential investors:

* CLOV did not disclose that its AI, Clover Assistant, is under active investigation by the Department of Justice. This investigation regards 12 issues from kickbacks to predatory marketing practices to undisclosed third-party dealings. While I won’t speculate on the severity of these allegations and the results of this investigation, it is alarming that CLOV was not forthright with its investors in revealing this information.
* CLOV has a large dependency on a broker called Seek Insurance which is 50% owned by CLOV. While it is not uncommon for healthcare insurers to use independent brokerages, it is very misleading for Seek Insurance to claim “unbiased and independent” advice with Medicare plans when they are owned by a Medicare Advantage insurer. CLOV responded saying that Seek Insurance is independently operated, but it is difficult to imagine that CLOV has no sway in them even though they own them.
* CLOV’s CEO, Vivek Garipalli, has a history of predatory price-gouging and all-around immoral business practices. Prior to founding CLOV, he owned CarePoint Health which operated 3 hospitals in New Jersey where he charged the highest emergency room service prices in the entire country. Furthermore, he was at the center of an alleged scheme to siphon $157M from his own business into his personal bank account through exorbitant management services charged by LLC’s under his name to his own company.

**Financials**

CLOV’s financials paint a picture of a rapidly growing company. Their revenues increased from $277M in 2018 to $680M in 2020. While their operating costs also grew, it grew at a significantly lesser rate leading to lower net losses in general. In 2018, CLOV reported net losses of $186M and in 2020, they had reduced this to $93M. Their net income losses, however follows a different trajectory. Due to losses from continued operations, their net income had losses of $200M in 2018, $364M in 2019, and $136M in 2020. While 2020 does represent their lowest losses ever, it is not entirely clear whether this is part of a trend or if it’s a one-off fluke.

Their balance sheet does not paint a pretty picture. With total assets of $270M and liabilities of $430M, it is clear that they must fund their continued operations through equity. Remember, they are losing over $100M per year as well. Thus, it is entirely possible that they will dilute their existing equity in order to fund continued operations.

**So, do I like CLOV?**

The short answer is no. CLOV is a small, but fast-growing insurer valued at $3.7B. While they definitely have impressive AI technology, it is not unique in the industry and will not be a moat for them. Their CEO has been involved in shady dealings in the past and the fact that they cannot be forthright about active investigations into their business is concerning. They are currently burning through cash without a healthy balance sheet to hold them through which means that it is likely they will issue additional equities to stay afloat. 

The industry that they are in is certainly lucrative and if they can get a foothold, they will justify their current valuation. However, for my personal conviction, the cons outweigh the pros and I will be passing on this stock.

**TLDR;**

1. CLOV first gained popularity as a short-squeeze “play” versus being a fundamentally solid company with potential growth.
2. Clover Health’s moat lies in Clover Assistant, which is a data analytics and AI platform used to better diagnose patients, saving CLOV on unplanned costs and increases revenue from their insurance policies. However, AI in healthcare is not a new concept. In fact 95% of health care executes are looking to hire business and analytics staff with experience developing AI.
3. Hindenburg Research released a short-report on the company that enlightens some facts and opinions for a bearish case. It also discloses that Clover Assistant is currently being investigated for predatory marketing practices.
4. Although the company has been having stellar revenue growth, their costs associated with revenue have also increased exponentially. Financially, they don’t have the best liquidity and are spending a lot of cash, which raises concerns for potential share dilution down the road.
5. Lastly, their total addressable market is still quite small. They are operating within a network of less than 60,000 members. Although there is room to grow this market to members of a lower age, you have to remember they are targeting medicare to elderly Americans."
63,63,"$BB ideas for Monday Disclaimer: I got out from $BB on Friday.

$BB dropped below $14.30 (50% Fib Retracement mark). This mark was tested and rejected multiple time from Thursday through Friday. However at around 2pm $BB dropped bellow. Bulls immediately tried regaining this level but got rejected and we closed below. The next level is 61.8%, $13. Bulls must hold this one in my opinion. There's a big hole that is still unfilled when $BB gapped up from June 1st to 2nd. If $BB goes below $13, then we might retest June 1st closing of $11.56 and 78.6% retracement mark of $11.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/Pv2AQcyz/

Volume on Friday also wasn't great. Comparing it to Thursday is a bit unfair since that was a record breaking day. That being said, Friday volume was a half of what it was on Wednesday. This was also $BBs first negative day of this run. Looking back to January, first negative day of that run also coincided with lower volume and that was basically the end of that run. Volume was keep decreasing since that day going forward. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/onHdg7BE/

On Monday:

* If $BB opens above $14.30, it will most likely try and retest 50% retracement again. If we hold above, might be a good place to jump back in. 

* If $BB opens between $14.30 and $13, just wait and see, that's noman's land. If $BB starts to slide then I'm looking for a strong rejection at $13 before even thinking about jumping back in. If we go below $13, then there are good chances we'll retest $11.5 and $11 marks. If $BB starts the morning strong and goes up, watch what happens at $14.30. Going above and stabilizing that is a good sign. 
* And of course I'm looking for better volume than last Friday if there's to be continuation of this run."
64,64,"How has the Reddit effect impacted cannabis stocks? On Tuesday 9th February, a user who claimed to make over 500,000 USD in earnings from the famous cannabis stocks Tilray and Aphrra boosted told the forum’s 8.8 million members that they still had a lot more room to rise. 


His post quickly started trending and today has around 13000 upvotes and 1200 comments.


Tilray has been in the news quite a lot lately. The Canada based, US listed company has been riding a wave of good news. It has made agreements to export its products to Europe, and is set to merge with Aphria to create the largest cannabis company. No wonder it has drawn attention from both hedge funds and private investors on r/wallstreetbets.


Since December 2020, when the merger announcement was first made, Tilray’s share price has jumped around 400%, while Aphria has grown 243%. Other companies are also riding this wave: Canopy Growth’s shares have doubled, and so has ETFMG Alternative Harvest, a fund tracking cannabis stocks all over the world.


Since Wednesday 10th February, Reddit Day traders have started showing a lot of interest in cannabis stocks. Both Tilray and Aphria have seen sudden spikes in demand, and their share prices increased 21% and 10% respectively. However, just like Gamestop, this interest was short lived.


On the other hand, short interest in Cannabis stocks is also high. According to Reuters, approximately 37% of Tilray’s free float (shares which are being actively traded in the market) is currently loaned out to hedge funds, up from 27.3% in January.


Hedge funds are also quite familiar with cannabis companies. For example, in 2018, Tilray’s price skyrocketed from $20 to $300 in the three months following legalization, and forced short sellers to hastily cover their positions by buying stocks (which were also not quite readily available for purchase). 


Nonetheless, according to Yahoo Finance, right now,  there is an approximately 51% short interest in Cannabis stocks by hedge funds and institutional investors. 


The only question remains is this, will the Reddit Effect make Tilray and Aphria the new Gamestop?

**PROS**

According to Bureau of Labor Statistics, the healthcare sector is the largest and fastest growing job segment in the US, employing over 20 million professionals in 2020. Total US employment between 2019 and 2029 is expected to grow by 15% for all healthcare professionals vs. 4% for all occupations. Men on average represented 25% of the US healthcare workforce in 2019, while men’s business represented only 17% of net revenues of 2020. In 2020, the total addressable market of the health apparel industry was an estimated $12B in the US and $79B globally, according to a Frost and Sullivan Study that FIGS commissioned. The same study says the total addressable market in the US is expected to grow by a 6.1% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) over the next 5 years from $12B in 2020 to approximately $16B in 2025.

FIGS sells 98% of their products through their digital platform, and leverages social media platforms to understand and better serve the community of healthcare professionals at scale. They also have an Ambassador Program ([Awesome Humans](https://www.wearfigs.com/pages/awesome-humans)), consisting of over 250 healthcare professionals from around the world, which further drives engagement with the community. In addition to the Ambassador Program, FIGS inspires customer loyalty by building authentic relationships. Through the #FIGSLOVE program, FIGS aims to be part of a professional's career by sending special gifts to them after career milestones like graduating from school or opening a new practice. Among US healthcare professionals and medical students, FIGS has aided and unaided brand awareness of 55% and 22%, respectively.

FIGS only recently achieved profitability and may not maintain profitability in the future. Additionally, the recent rapid growth may not be sustainable or indicative of future growth, and they expect the growth rate to ultimately slow over time.

**CONCLUSION**

Given the recent IPO, I expect there to be some price movement and for it to drop in the upcoming weeks. I will wait for a better reentry price. With that said, healthcare apparel continuously needs to be replenished, resulting in highly predictable, recurring demand. FIGS has room to grow over the next 3-5 years and I like it as a longer term investment.

67,67,"SOFI/23andME What are yalls thoughts on SOFI and 23andME. I know these are not the typical investment of choice for this sub but here me out

SOFI - This company recently merged and shot up from $15.15 to 23ish at its peak. The only reason this compny goes down are consistent short attacks. This stock has a book value of easily $26/$30. This has massive potential and if you guys wanna make some money waiting on gme this is the way. 

23andME- This company will be merging on the 10th of june and the call contracts have been going up like crazy even though the price has not yet moved from 10 dollars. I am thinking the $12.5 17 dec and $10 july calls are going to bring at least 50% in just a couple weeks.

70,70,"I analyzed all the controversial trades made by Senators in the 2020 Congressional insider trading scandal. Here are the results! **Preamble:** The ability of Congress Members to trade stocks has been controversial from the start. There have been multiple stories covering the 2020 congressional [insider trading scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_congressional_insider_trading_scandal) where Congress Members allegedly used insider knowledge to trade large positions in stocks just before the coronavirus pandemic crash. But none of the articles talked about the financial implications of those trades and whether the retail investors could have front-run the market using the disclosed data.  Basically, what I wanted to know was

**How much did the Senators save by offloading their positions before the crash and could I have done the same?**

**Where is the data from**: efdsearch.senate.gov

For my [previous analysis into congressional trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/n958n7/i_analyzed_9000_trades_made_by_us_senators_in_the/), I used data from senatestockwatcher.com. But not all the transactions are captured on the website and I wanted to match exactly with the trades reported by famous journals. efdsearch.senate.gov is the United States official website where Senator, former Senator, and candidate financial disclosure reports are available. Some of the data is available as a scanned file and some in normal HTML format. I had to manually transcribe most of the data used in this analysis.

In case you are wondering about the time delay between the actual transaction and reporting, Congress Members are expected to [report the transaction within 30 days](https://www.citizen.org/article/personal-financial-disclosure-requirements-for-public-officials/). The median delay in reporting that I observed for all the trades was 28 days.

All the trades and my analysis are shared as a google sheet at the end.

**Analysis:**

There are multiple factors at play here.

Timeline: On January 24, 2020, the Senate Committees on Health and Foreign Relations held a closed meeting with only Senators present to brief them about the COVID-19 outbreak and how it would affect the United States. I am considering this as the start time for my analysis. Any sale made by the senators after this point up to Feb 26 is considered. (I did not consider sales beyond that point as SPY dropped 8% during that week. My assumption here is it’s realistic for any person be it a normal investor or a Senator to panic sell after seeing that drop). For reference, SPY dropped an additional 25% over the next 3 weeks!  

Senators under consideration: I have considered trades done by 4 senators in my analysis. I have focused on these 4 as all of them were investigated by [Justice Department and the FBI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_congressional_insider_trading_scandal) following the trading scandal.

1. Richard Burr
2. Kelly Loeffler
3. James M Inhofe
4. David A Perdue

https://preview.redd.it/owzxgiv17g371.png?width=751&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbb5ec251a813bfcaf6d954b3992263b167ebdbd

David Perdue sold 44 times ($3.49 MM) in the 33 days following the closed senate meeting. Interestingly James Inhofe only transacted 8 times but the combined value of shares he sold was a whopping $4.12MM. The most ironic part is that Richard Burr who was under investigation the longest and had to step down from the intelligence committee due to the scandal had the least dollar volume in the transaction ($1.1MM).

**Results:**

Before we dive into the overall amount saved by the Senators and the retail investor side of the analysis, let’s see what were the best trades made by the Senators during that time period.  

https://preview.redd.it/zzkp2rh37g371.png?width=1038&format=png&auto=webp&s=02669d67934a2bc1e4b0dc54f5a4ff97860c8b0e

 David Perdue absolutely killed it with his stock plays. He is present 7 times in the top 10 list and his best play, Caesars Entertainment reduced 83% after he sold his position. Fun Fact: if a stock reduces 83%, it has to go up 488% just to reach back to its initial price. Another interesting observation from the chart is that senators mainly sold stocks related to the entertainment and hospitality industries which were the most severely affected industries due to the pandemic. 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/vzd0kq757g371.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec18cc544fefb81597f8929af51b299cf36edc65)

The above chart showcases the amount of money saved by the Senators due to front running the market crash. David Perdue saved an insane $2.2MM with his stock sales. I also kept a multiple of annual Senate salary to showcase the scale of impact they made to their portfolio because of the trades.

Finally, we come to the million-dollar question. **Was it possible for the retail investors to follow these trades and front-run the crash?**

This is where the analysis gets a bit tricky. 88% of the transactions were reported by March 3rd but if you consider it in dollar values, only 52% of the transactions were reported (some of the high-value transactions were reported only after the crash). But if you were an astute investor, you could have observed a stark difference in what the Senators were saying and how they were trading. For Eg. [Richard Burr reassured the public that the US was well prepared](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/5/14/21258560/senator-richard-burr-coronavirus-insider-trading-scandal-explained) for the pandemic but then sold $1MM worth of stocks in the next two weeks. I know that hindsight is 20/20 but if you could have connected these two dots, then you could have saved up to **25% of your portfolio** before the crash.

**Limitations of analysis:** There are some limitations to the analysis.

a. I have only used one black swan event for the analysis. A better method would be to analyze the stock trading pattern over 3-4 major crashes and see if any pattern emerges. But the current limitation is that efdsearch.senate.gov has only data since 2012.

b. There is no disclosure for the exact amount of money invested by Congress Members. The disclosure is always in ranges (e.g., $100k – $200k). So, for calculating the transaction amount, I have taken the average of the given range.

**Conclusion**

I intentionally left out the party affiliation of the Senators as I did not want our political views clouding our financial judgment. I could not find a single example where a retail investor or an institutional investor or even a hedge fund leveraging this information to make their trades (it might just not be public!). Another possible explanation here is that Senators might just have superior stock trading capability as [none of them were indicted for this and all investigations are closed now](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/19/us/politics/richard-burr-stock-trades-investigation.html).

However you view it, this analysis in addition to my [last analysis (which proves that Congress Members have better returns than SP500)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/nsvk50/i_analyzed_all_the_controversial_trades_made_by/) showcases that there is significant money to be made by following their trades closely!

74,74,"DD RNG potential if compared with Hydrogen & BEVs, USA (California) regulatory and legislative focus Hello everyone, 

here a DD focused on RNG and Natural Gas developments in the USA, as previous one was more broad and had the intention to outline the state of the industry worldwide.

As you may know, California has always been at the center of attention as the most advanced state in terms of decarbonization efforts. Yet, it seems that not all decisions paid back in terms of quality of life and certainty of business activity.

**Californian** **Natural Gas power plants shut down, electricity imported from other states:**

Indeed, California, different from what someone would expect, has not a good and reliable supply of electricity, probably because it pushed too aggressively for the state's 100% electrification goal (see attached picture). During the most recent blackout in August 2020, some Electric buses were forced to shut down, in order to reduce electricity demand. In the next decade, virtual power plants' alike experiments will be more popular, therefore it is reasonable to expect a better match between the demand & supply of green electricity. But it will take time and for safety reasons, it would be better to rely on different sources of energy.

* [2020-08-21 Washington Examiner: California forced to defend green goals amid blackouts](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/california-forced-to-defend-green-goals-amid-blackouts)
* [2020-08-23 Oil & Gas 360 : Green California has the nation's worst power grid](https://www.oilandgas360.com/green-california-has-the-nations-worst-power-grid/)

The first question that arises, reading these topics, is about the never-ending announcements of companies like Nikola $NKLA (very dubious business potential) and Tesla $TSLA (amazing company with incredible potential) about the incoming, quick and easy electrification of Heavy Duty Transports.

**Hydrogen Alternative Focus**

Nikola revealed its lack of technological breakthrough when it was revealed that General Motors had the intention to market a Hydrogen trucks with the Nikola brand and...... GM Fuel Cells!! The drama related to the CEO trials made the rest. I am a huge fan of hydrogen , but as Cummins $CMI CEO confirmed, hydrogen trucks have a long long way to go before being adopted on a large scale (please note that [Cummins acquired Hydrogenics in Sept. 2019](https://www.cummins.com/news/releases/2019/09/09/cummins-closes-its-acquisition-hydrogenics) (second global leader after $BLDP in hydrogen fuel cells). According to Cummins and others, in the next years electrolyzer segment will grow first. Note that the hydrogen fuel needed for hypothetical trucks on California's road would need green hydrogen, thus it will put more stress on the grid.. Even if it is not focused on the US, I recommend readers this report of David Fickling about global green hydrogen potential by 2050. 

[According to David Fickling](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/the-hydrogen-economys-time-is-approaching/2020/05/08/383b1a04-9191-11ea-9322-a29e75effc93_story.html), hydrogen could meet 24% of the world’s energy needs by 2050, but it would likely take 31’320 TWh of electricity to hit this level. Last year, the entire world generated just roughly 26’000 TWh, of which 10’000 were coming from zero-carbon sources. By 2050 it may be achievable, but there are shorter deadlines for the transport sector. Actions today are required to match 2025 and 2030 emission targets.

If we want a high percentage of **green hydrogen**, a huge amount of grid investments is required today; high-tension grid infrastructure needs 5-10 years to be completed, therefore it is reasonable to say that hydrogen will be a sound reality for mobility from the late 2020’s on, not earlier. In addition, the potential of exhausted salt mines that could store hydrogen for months is just theoretical for now.

It is worth to remember that the sources for electricity generation in Europe are diversified and are not ready for a 100% renewable energy scenario:

* **Germany renounced to nuclear power** in 2011 and will renounce to coal by 2030, and the country is massively investing in gas pipelines, so it is very likely that it will not renounce to Russian gas.
* **France relies heavily on nuclear power**, with some of these power plants being soon too old to remain active. Therefore, traditional gas generation will be a  likely alternative to overcome this problem.
* **The UK closed all its coal power plants** but decided to keep open nuclear and gas facilities.
* **Italy** relies heavily on gas and does not have any nuclear power plant.

None of Europe’s largest countries can afford a 100% green electricity sector that can satisfy both current demand plus the incremental demand coming from the green hydrogen sector. Therefore, some fossil fuel (natural gas) and nuclear plants are here to stay for the longer term.

**BLUE HYDROGEN CANNOT BE IGNORED -** The argument is different if we include in the discussion blue hydrogen along with carbon capture. In this scenario, we would need massive incentives and research investments in carbon capture technology, which now are still at an early stage. According to the European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen, [who spoke at the World Economic Forum in January 2020](https://www.ft.com/content/c93694c8-3d15-11ea-a01a-bae547046735), the EU will define the structure of a continental carbon tax by the end of this year (pre-COVID-19 intention, very likely now that the details will be published in 2021). For this reason, large trade partners like the US and China were advised to start their own studies on the tax, if they do not want their goods to be taxed at the highest possible carbon emission rate.

**HYDROGEN TRAIN FOCUS** \- An interesting case in this regard is the Hydrogen train developed by Alstom and Hydrogenics (now Cummins Inc.) whose adoption has been delayed considerably. Alstom was able to sell its innovative product to some German and French regions. Nevertheless, in most of the cases hydrogen will come from fossil sources (Rhyne region etc.), with cleaner alternatives being provided at a later stage. In the region of Schleswig Holstein, where the green potential was massive, Alstom could have got the greatest commercial order for a hydrogen product worldwide; however, the green fueling station was at the heart of a controversy between the company and the tender offer authorities of Schleswig-Holstein. For this reason, 52 trains were allocated to the battery train manufacturer and the Alstom (Hydrogenics) & NEL consortium lost the tender offer. The proposed fueling station was massive for the time, being around 20 MW capacity, [but the cost of it was at the expense of the consortium](https://www.ln-online.de/Lokales/Lauenburg/Aus-fuer-die-Wasserstoffzelle-auf-der-Schiene).

**BEV Infrastructure focus**

Tesla instead kept postponing the launch of its Tesla SEMI. You can read again the last conference call transcripts which clearly states that the biggest issue from a product perspective is the fast charger technology, whose time of realization and commercialization is yet unknown. From a macro perspective instead is unclear how California may afford to charge thousands of Tesla SEMI with its current electricity grid.

**How does $CLNE fits into all this?**

 If you look at 2020 Q2 CC of $CLNE , management made a quite useful comparison for H2 fueling stations and BEV charging stations for heavy-duty. They told the story of a recharging facility in Los Angeles that was going to be built for $5.5 million to recharge 24 heavy-duty trucks in a day’s time, in like 20-hour time, using the equivalent of the electricity needed for 44’000 homes (!!!). Thus, it is reasonable to expect not many fleet operators to switch soon to BEV trucks. 

About hydrogen refueling, management commented on the experience they got operating a hydrogen station in California with on-site hydrogen generation through electrolysis:

“*Get a load of this, it requires about 20 gallons of water (each gallon is 3.785 liters) for every gallon of hydrogen you produce. So march that out on a nationwide scale. And the idea that we're going to do it with renewable sources at a station is going to be very daunting, okay?*

*I think that as you look at commercial truck stops with hydrogen, you're probably looking at something on the order of $15 million to $20 million, or more, per station. So this is a very expensive proposition because you're basically creating a whole new network. And really, the most successful stations around the world, and there's only a handful of hydrogen, is you're reforming natural gas.”*

It is clear why some fleet operators are switching to Natural Gas Trucks. Amazon in February and the Port of LA recently, with the decision to equate BEV and other Zero Emission trucks to the Natural Gas ones. 

**US Congress ""Californification"" , not so fast**

In the past legislative period, there were some bipartisan attempts to support RNG and Natural Gas mobility. US Congress has indeed shown some interest in the subject. Last June, a bipartisan effort was introduced in both the chambers of the US congress. The bill is called “[Growing Climate Solutions Act](https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/09/10/growing-climate-solutions-act-gives-farmers-a-seat-at-the-carbon-market-table/)” and would allow farmers to generate revenue streams from different forms of carbon capture. Most notably, methane from livestock is mentioned in the legislation. If enacted at  the federal level, decarbonized gas would receive a renovated interest from many different stakeholders. [Being a bipartisan deal](https://www.audubon.org/news/indiana-senator-mike-braun-discusses-bipartisan-climate-solutions-young-leaders), as farmers represent a prized electoral category, it should be enacted regardless of the next election results.

President Biden needs to show to his party and the American people that he is doing something about the environment. That is why he advertised the Ford BEV pickup and keeps saying that government's fleets will be electrified. As always, the political reality is much more complex than the headline announcements, and RNG has a lot of room to grow in this space. 

[Already in 2020, RNG represented 53% of all Natural Gas used in transport in the USA](https://bioenergyinternational.com/markets-finance/rng-surpassed-ng-accounting-for-53-percent-of-us-on-road-ngv-fuel-use-in-2020) . As noted in a previous DD, in California RNG is 90% of NG used in transport.

Let me know if you have further questions!

Ok apes, chimps, gorillas, primates of all stripes... I'm going to level with you. I am posting this mainly because I want to throw one of my best ideas into the ring. But that's not the only reason I am writing this. I also want to inspire those of you who are just getting started in this game. For those who say that retail investors can't consistently make money in markets, I present you with some recent gain porn for your viewing pleasure. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gyvyzp0yln371.png?width=1355&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf56089ae7e9cff017cacdc546e9aa3c9e55f329

Look, I won't lie, making money investing is not easy -- lots of smart people are trying to do the same thing. But the real challenge is having the emotional resilience to stick with your thesis, and while not easy, if you stick to basic math and only invest in what you know, it is simple. 

As retail investors, we have a huge advantage over the big guys on Wall Street who need to hug the benchmarks, satisfy investor demands for quarterly results and invest only where they can expect to generate acceptable ""risk-adjusted"" returns where risk is bizarrely defined as ""volatility"", instead of permanent impairment of capital, which is how I see it. 

We can arbitrage these structural weaknesses in institutional portfolio management by making contrarian bets on stocks that are currently out of favor with the big guys, provided we've done our homework on the business and believe that it is undervalued. Eventually, if we are right about the trajectory of the business, they will eventually be forced to buy us out at a huge premium when the results prove out and herd mentality kicks back in the other way. 

I've made a nice chunk of coin on several positions over the last few years, which has enabled me to make bigger investments, and I am currently up materially on my latest portfolio positions. These are positions I have held for long time periods, with Bed Bath and Beyond being the largest position, the longest held and highest percentage gains. In my view, it also has the most upside, so I want to share a bit more with you about my thesis.

**Nothing I've said or am about to say should be construed in any way as investment advice.** **This is just me sharing my YOLO, with an explanation for my thesis.** 

Bed Bath and Beyond was a successful business when it first arrived on the scene, practically creating and defining the concept of Big Box Retail. As so often happens in life, their huge initial success bred complacency, and the co-founders (Warren Eisenberg and Leonard Feinstein) who continued presiding over the Board basically ran the company like it was their private piggy bank, without regard for small (or even large) shareholders. 

Under the leadership of Steven Temares, the CEO they handpicked, the business failed to innovate and keep up with basic changes taking place in retail -- such as the rise of e-commerce. BBBY began to see online giants like Amazon and even brick & mortar mass merchants like Target and Lowes begin to eat their lunch. Steven Temares, along with the rest of the c-suite, continued to receive huge salaries and bonuses, while the two co-founders received generous perks like personal black-car chauffer services, all paid for by the company -- and therefore, shareholders. 

They also refused to answer basic questions posited by Wall Street research analysts on earnings calls, seeing the investment community essentially as a nuisance to be tolerated but not proxies for the true owners of the business -- public investors. 

Well, the situation got so bad that finally, circa mid-2019 in the year of our chimp lord, a trifecta of activist investors led by Legion Partners (founder was trained by legendary activist Nelson Peltz) and John Duskin at Macellum Capital decided to wage war, buying up \~6% of the stock and filing a 170 white paper detailing all of the problems with how the company was being run and proposing to replace the entire Board of Directors and management team with its own slate of nominees (the presentation is phenomenal, and if you PM me I will email it to you). 

They went so far as to create a website for their campaign, [restorebedbath.com](https://restorebedbath.com/), which they eventually dismantled after reaching a cooperation and settlement agreement with the Board of Directors. This agreement effectively ceded control to the activists, who proceeded to replace everyone. It was a real Red Wedding style bloodbath... I mean total scorched earth policy... no respect for life. While it's never pleasant seeing people get canned, these people deserved it. After years and years of unaccountable shareholder abuse, someone finally came along and pulled out the game cartridge, blew on it and hit ""reset"" on the console. And they saw that it was good. 

In November 2019 they announced Mark Tritton, legendary Chief Merchandising Officer from Target who was the main person responsible for their massive success in developing private label / owned brand programs, would be taking the helm as CEO. Since taking charge, Mark has consistently been executing on the playbook laid out by the activists in their white paper, which basically calls for making low risk / high return changes to bring Bed Bath and Beyond up to modern retailing standards using well established best practices. 

While some would argue that a turnaround of this magnitude carries high execution risk, I would disagree at this time for several reasons: (1) The changes they have been making are actually quite well established strategies for modern retailing, with loads of case studies to pull from (Best Buy, Target, Lowes, etc); (2) they have the best team you could ask for implementing these changes (i.e., Mark Tritton and John Hartmann, who became COO of BBBY after a highly successful run as CEO of True Value hardware chains); (3) their compensation is heavily geared towards stock compensation, so **they only win if we all win;** and (4) most of the highest risk action plans, like divesting of non-core assets, culling unproductive / unprofitable stores, reducing bloated headcount and liquidating stale inventories at reasonable valuations, are all in the rear-view mirror. 

As of June 2021, Bed Bath and Beyond is at an inflection point with a strong focus on driving profitable growth from its core business lines. This comes down to a few very important strategies: (1) focusing on digital first, omni-always capabilities (leading with the website and mobile app but making sure they are able to serve customers however, whenever and wherever they want to shop -- think curbside pick-up, same-day delivery and buy-online pick-up in store aka BOPIS); (2) focusing on key destination categories where the company is seen as an authority in the home, driving preference for BBBY over other chains and even national brands by defining its key categories using data and developing owned brands to fill out their assortment in those areas (they have launched 6 so far this year, with another 4 expected by end of year -- ultimately they expect 30% of their sales to come from the brands they have created). This will help help them in multiple ways. First, the products are only going to be available at BBBY, so they are re-establishing their authority in the home and preference for BBBY as a brand and not just a venue to shop other manufacturers' products (this also means these items can't be bought online except for thru BBBY, so it is Amazon defense playbook 101). Second, these products have been strategically developed in areas where they had gaps in their assortment relative to the competitors they were losing share to. As mentioned above, development of these brands was informed by **data**, including detailed line reviews and purchasing data. Third, and final, these products are designed to cost and have very healthy margins that should improve the overall margin profile of the business as they are rolled out. This fireside chat with Mark Tritton from January 2021 explains it all far better than I can, and is well worth watching for curious apes: 

[https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/videos/a-fireside-chat-with-mark-tritton-president-and-ceo-of-bed-bath-and-beyond/](https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/videos/a-fireside-chat-with-mark-tritton-president-and-ceo-of-bed-bath-and-beyond/)

**So where does this all leave us today?**

The company has successfully implemented its digital first, omni-always capabilities, rolling out BOPIS, curbside pickup and same-day delivery (just signed up deals with Instacart & Doordash). Digital sales were up 86% in the most recent quarter and 99% in the Bed Bath banner (they also own Buy Buy Baby, which is the largest national baby retail chain in the US with the bankruptcy of Babies R US -- this alone makes BBBY an interesting investment with tons of hidden value).

For the first time in **years**, the company began posting positive same-store sales for the last 3 quarters under Mark Tritton (consistently comping up in the mid-single digits). This is a very positive sign of the changes taking place already. Same-store sales metrics are probably the most important data point for retailers, as it basically tells you if consumers think they have a good reason to exist. Quite frankly, it is an extraordinary achievement by Mark and his team that after years of declining same-store sales they are now positive for 3 consecutive quarters, and I don't think this has gotten enough attention.

They have also begun launching their new owned brands, with 6 already launched and another 4 or so on the way this year. These brands have a strong focus on their top 5 destination categories (bedding, bath, kitchen & food prep, indoor decor, and organization) -- I've personally purchased and used these products, and they are excellent quality at reasonable price points. I think they will do great.

They are repurchasing $1bn of their own stock (at least $375mm completed so far at an average price of \~$23 per share, reducing their share count from \~126mm to \~109mm.

Normalizing their revenues for divested brands and culling of unprofitable / lowest productivity stores in their footprint, management has guided to \~$8.2bn of sales and $525mm of EBITDA **this year,** with sales comping up in the low- to mid-single digits range for the next several years and EBITDA margins improving to high single digits / low double digits resulting in EBITDA of $850mm-$1bn by YE 2023.

Applying simple mathematics and established standards of value, I believe the evidence shows that businesses in this industry (big box and specialty retail) would typically be valued at \~8-12x EBITDA which would imply an enterprise value (value of the whole business, not just the equity) of \~$9bn at the midpoint, which seems eminently reasonable for an iconic retailer under solid leadership with about 1000 stores and authority in key growing segments of the US economy.

Since they have virtually the same amount of cash as debt, the enterprise value should be about the same as the equity value, so \~$9bn at the midpoint above. With \~109mm shares outstanding today, that puts implied equity value per share at \~$82, but where it gets even more interesting is if you factor in the share buybacks. They've still got $625mm of remaining authorized share repurchases under their existing program, and depending on how cheap they are able to buy those shares they could materially reduce the share count further.

**So why are the big institutional investors continuing to ignore this stock? Why does everyone continue to ignore the insanely cheap valuation and upside potential under the extraordinary new leadership of Mark Tritton, John Hartmann and the rest of the new team?** 

I can think of several possibilities, but probably the main one is a backward looking bias, because the memory of the old management team and their awful performance dies hard. Their prolonged period of value destruction also gave rise to a narrative, parroted widely by thematic investors and talking heads on CNBC, basically a nonsense theory that all brick & mortar would die and the consumer would only ever want to shop at Amazon (somehow ignoring blatantly contradictory evidence provided by Target, Lowes, Walmart, etc). 

In this excellent interview with burgeoning hedge fund manager Dan McMurtrie (aka Supermugatu), he discusses the reality of how Amazon is killing bad retail, not all retail, and how certain investors / the media have taken the the idea way too far as they so often love to do. **I cannot recommend this highly enough -- well worth watching beginning at 39:45.**

[https://www.realvision.com/unmasking-supermugatu-how-the-pros-find-edge](https://www.realvision.com/unmasking-supermugatu-how-the-pros-find-edge)

It might take some time for BBBY to shake off the worries created during the former management team's tenure. Most of the time, the stock market is forward looking, but in this case investors have adopted a thesis that has them psychologically stuck in the past due to PTSD, and the distractions in rear-view mirror are blinding them to what is likely to happen in the next 6, 12, 18 months. 

Eventually, I personally expect BBBY to shock the market with positive results one of these quarters, forcing a rapid, seemingly unexpected valuation revision in the stock. They have already begun to put up excellent numbers, if you look at the underlying same-store sales, digital growth, growth in top 5 destination categories, for example. However, there has still been a lot of noise in the numbers from divestitures, culling of store footprint, COVID impact in 2020, etc., and it appears that perception has not caught up yet with the new reality.

While I haven't focused on it much here, the company also has an excellent balance sheet with over $1bn of cash, no meaningful near-term debt maturities, solidly positive free cash flow generation & very high short interest.

Even with all of the prevailing negative sentiment, this has been a profitable investment for me so far (I purchased heavily in periods where others abandoned hope over the last few years). In my opinion, the company is probably worth about $80 / share as of today, however with continued solid execution and more enthusiasm coming back into the name, I could see this valued well into the triple digits. 

So, even with my sizeable gains I haven't sold one share and don't plan to anytime soon. I am holding this baby to the end."

80,80,"BB$ Stock Weekend DD before Jun 7th 2021. Rockets up.  

Share Structure: Shares outstanding = 566.22M

Shares held be insiders = 1.48%

Shares held by institutions = 42.39%

Shares in the float = 56.13% = 317,819,286 Short interest = 50.23M (which could be a lot higher with the gap in reports) Short volume Friday = 23.69% = 41,266,003

At least 1/3 of the trading float will need to cover and it can't be done in one day. That's why all these hedge funds are calling up their pals to write all their bear stories to try to induce panic/fear selling to help them because they have leveraged too much risk into the trade.

Sounds like they didn't learn their lesson from 2008. If the accumulation continues with high volume days, bears and hedge funds are in big trouble."

82,82,"BlackBerry Technical Analysis Technical Analysis on BB for anyone interested. Total float 565m shares. Shares held by institutions (not actively traded=**roughly 50%**, insiders own **1.5%**).. 48.5% of 565m shares is **275m** shares that are frequently traded. I updated original post as original was made rather quickly and there's been some questions. Also, do your own DD, these are just my thoughts and not advice.

Intro:

**\*\*\* MY CHARTS KEEP GETTING DELETED..\*\*\*LMK when this occurs plz**

June 2nd saw a nice jump in SP with a close outside of the Bollinger Bands on **346m** share volume.  Mean reversion is typically expected following strong closes that finish outside or near the edge of the bands.

June 3 + 4-There were **700m** shares traded on US exchange alone. **Important point:** June 3rd and 4th were sell offs with attempts to revert to the mean...Likely a fair bit of profit taking as well but shares were being dumped all day. The mean currently sits at 9.78USD (middle red line in Bollinger Bands). They didn't even come close.. the stock still sits outside of the bands \*\*extremely bullish signal. This is a massive game of hot potato right now as we've churned through the entire float twice since June 2 (4x if you disregard shares that aren't actively traded). That much volume occurring outside of the bands relative to the float is unbelievably bullish IMO.

**Technical analysis set up:**

Image 1 (below): Bollinger bands revert to mean but failed

\*\*\*SELL OFF HAS LIKELY FAILED\*\*\*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Image 2 (below): shows an symmetrical triangle or wedge with declining volume as we move towards apex AKA volatility contraction. This occurs prior to volatility expansion (prior to a large move).

Image 3 (below): image shows strong buying pressure @ 14 dollars as evidenced by multiple attempts to drive the price down that immediately bounced off that area. Last 1.5 days has been an attempt to slowly bleed it down to just above the buying pressure in hopes you'll sell them back your shares and help cover. Notice the Friday close stopped immediately above buying pressure.

https://preview.redd.it/tcqeuojw5k371.png?width=1962&format=png&auto=webp&s=29b44a910817556862abb1479becc8abd59d80b9

**Price target-->** IMO could easily end up within 25-40 dollar range or higher next week based on where shorts are reapplied. Shorts were reapplied around 25 to 30 USD in January so that's probably the next stop.

**Things to consider:**

1. Potential exists that this scenario doesn't play out on Monday and we head lower. More selling= more synthetic shares. More fake shares= more of a problem in the future for whoever is short. Just means the larger this squeeze is going to become overtime. So good for whoever's accumulating at the right price and holding on. Remember that there is great buying pressure below us!
2. It's uncommon for trends to reverse without some sort of ranging period where shares are either accumulated or distributed. Remember, we are in an uptrend in the intermediate and long term. We have not reached distribution phase yet. Short term there may be some more pain if we continue lower but this will result in an even bigger squeeze in the long term as more shares must be fabricated so dumping can continue.
3. At this point, BB is a better set up in comparison to AMC. AMC has done multiple stock sales to help out those that are short. Blackberry has yet to issue any shares. Also, if we do continue downward, BB is more favorable as it's a popular stock that would be purchased at this price by retail investors who are planning to hold long term. Based on warnings given by AMC management, their stock is extremely overpriced.14 USD and below begins to have nice support!!
4. If BB management has any idea what they are doing, they'll act on this with some big news:).
5. Proof I am holding for those questioning the validity of the account.

**MONDAY GONNA BE ZOPPITY!!!!LFG!!!**"
83,83,"$WDC Western Digital DD: Part 2 Link to part 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ntqwp7/wdc_western_digital_is_being_driven_up_by_chia/

Chia, a 'green' alternative to GPU mining has caused a global shortage of hard discs. I commented on the increased demand, and the earnings expectations in my previous DD.

Chia uses a proof of space approach to mining that relies on using empty hard disc space. The high profitability of mining thiscaused a surge in demand for hard discs.

However, Chia mining is largely popular in Central and SE Asia right now, with some movement in the West. I expect as more people become aware of this, particularly in the West - it will lead to a shortage of hard discs and SSD's much like the current GPU shortage. There is already a shortage of HDD's/SSD's due to the initial surge of Chia interest causing a buyup of these items. However, as it gains traction, and as people realise how this is much more highly profitable in comparison to GPU mining currently - the demand will be similar to that of GPU's. 

This initial surge I mention, has indeed already caused a surge in the stock prices. With Western digital share price being $52 at the start of the year and now around $77/78. Seagate is also up from $60 to $99. 

Hoffman, the president of Chia Network, says he 'is suprised at the speed at which the hard disc capacity devoted to Chia has grown and admits that this is likely to caused disruptions to the supply chain for some time.'.

In summary, Chia is more profitable and more energy efficient than GPU mining. Hard drive demand has already spiked leading to shortages. I expect as this grows in profitability in Asia and the west, it will lead to further shortages much like that we see of HDD's.
Therefore driving up the stock price as already has been shown."

""*With President Biden’s proposal to invest $174 billion in electric vehicle (EV) development, the domestic EV industry could witness solid growth soon despite short-term hurdles such as a global semiconductor chip shortage. Supportive government policies and regulations worldwide should also contribute to the industry’s growth.

""In March 2021, FSR announced that it had agreed with Crédit Agricole Consumer Finance--which is part of the Crédit Agricole Group, the leading financial partner to the French economy and one of the largest banking groups in Europe--on the potential supply of Fisker Ocean SUVs. The agreement would give employees and the private banking market access to Fisker Ocean, with its latest generation technology and performance, while reinforcing Crédit Agricole’s commitment to a low-carbon fleet.

For the first quarter, ended March 31, 2021, FSR reported $22,000 in revenue. Also, the company’s net cash provided by financing activities came in at $88.74 million, compared to  $145,000 in the prior-year quarter.

Analysts expect FSR’s revenue for 2022 to be $416.58 million, representing 3.16% year-over-year growth. The company’s EPS is expected to increase 253.13% year-over-year for its fiscal year ending December 31, 2021.

Of the eight analysts that rated the stock, four have rated it Buy. A $24.71 consensus price target represents a potential 81.6% gain from its last closing price of $13.61.""

""""From November 17, 2022 we will start production and deliveries of the Fisker Ocean SUV, with Denmark, Norway and Sweden among the first European markets to launch,"" commented Fisker Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Henrik Fisker.

🌝The NighMan Charteth 🖍"
87,87,"Four undervalued growth stocks in an overvalued market. First off is huya. Huya is a twitch competitor in the Chinese region. They are mostly owned by Tencent and therefore have exclusive rights to stream Tencent games. Their current p/e works out to 25 and peg of 0.6. Excepted growth in earnings is around 44 percent this year and a potential merger is underway with a competitor that would give them a monopoly on the industry in China and thus market in-elasticity. They have a market cap of 3 billion dollars and have a whopping 1.5 billion in cash meaning losing over 50 percent is a near impossibly as the book value would exceed the share price. It’s down 60 percent from it’s peak in a growing market and i thought I’d share it with you.


Second one is General Motors. This may seem like an interesting one as General Motors is thought of a slow growing automotive company but gm currently trades at a p/e of around 10. With almost 20 billion dollars on its balance sheet. More importantly the company is on the forefront of the automotive industry. They have a controlling stake in an autonomous driving company called cruise which is now valued at 30 billion dollars or half their market cap. They have the second best battery technology on the market and they have a profitable electric car business and expect to invest 20 billion dollars into electric cars in the next couple of years. They produce battery powertrains that are extremely efficient and are the second cheapest to make and are selling it to third party companies. Overall they are on the forefront of multiple industries and are turning into more of a technology company whose future profits could very well be driven by strong software profits instead of hardware


Third one is Corsair. Corsair gaming currently trades at a p/e of around 20. Last year it had revenue growth of 75 percent and its forward pe now works out to a 15, which is extremely low for the growth of the company. As streaming picks up so has the demand for the companies products do as well they own Elgato (the biggest streaming equipment brand on earth), they also own origin pc, and are extremely good value because they can secure deals directly from Corsair giving them advantage in the sector. Overall Corsair has high growth,low pe, and an exceptional outlook.

Fourth and final one is baozun. Baozun does e-commerce distribution and management for overseas companies coming into the Chinese e-commerce market. E-commerce in China is a rapidly growing industry not expected to slow down at all in coming years and as China continues to open up it’s economy by reducing regulations on foreign brands, we should see baozun capitalise on such. It’s p/e is a bit higher then the rest at 35 but it’s expected growth of 33 percent puts that down to 27. It has a good balance sheet with 400 million in cash and also has a shopify like business for small businesses in China. Overall a great stock at a fair price."

91,91,"GOL - Some Brazilian airline I'm bullish on this Brazilian airline stock with a ticker of GOL.  Mainly because the flight attendants are all hot.  I imagine they are like what American flight attendants were before unions made it impossible to fire them (I'm looking at you United flight attendants).  Also, buying GOL now is like buying LUV or ALK 9 months ago.  There should be 20% to 30% upside in GOL as Brazil gradually gets their pandemic under control.  Their government flubbed the vaccine rollout but things are gradually improving."

Whoever tells you clov : $CLOV shorts are still up $3 million in mark-to-market profits for the month and up $90 million for the year. Even though they are down big over the last week, shorts won't cover in size (short squeeze) until they are deep in the red.



Whoever tells you bb:  you’ll notice the short interest has been to low, it would take months to have them cover.  Short sellers would need to be in the red for far too long before a squeeze can even be considered.

Revenues are in a heavy up-trend YOY, Extremely high revenue growth potential, profitable in the next 2-3 years, product diversification, and many more.

To me personally, the addition of Aphria was a great decision. Tilray is now a mega cannabis company. Aphria was the #1 cannabis company on the planet in terms of raw financial performance. These two powerhouse companies are going to lead the charge in medicinal cannabis.

Legislation appears to be in the favor of cannabis which will ultimately reverse this long term negative down-trend. With TLRY being the now industry leader, I believe they will benefit the most from favorable legislation.

&#x200B;

However, with all of those positive characteristics in mind, Tilray is being shorted to Shanghai. Why? Is it for the monetary gain of people who can afford to short companies?

Short term: With investors tripling down on short bets as shown on Bloomberg, things could get interesting. I believe that retail is in control of this play. Can we get it back to 150$ where it belongs?"
96,96,"CPI / inflation Data + Important FED meeting coming up = 🐻💵🤑💴 So first of all I want to stress the point that I am not a financial advisor of any kind! Shorting and puts are very dangerous if done incorrectly since you can lose a lot of money really quick. Anyways here's my DD:

Next week will be a huge opportunity for puts and shorts since it is basically almost guaranteed that the markets will sell off. 

As you all know next week we will have May CPI data released. The CPI data will show how much inflation has increased since April. When CPI data is higher than expected expect a huge sell off due to inflation FUD. This will hopefully force the FED to taper bonds and hopefully monthly inflation fud will be permanently gone after July.

In the rare case that magic exist and inflation somehow got lower compared to April we will still see a sell off. Why? Because now Jerome Powell will delay the tapering because ""the economy has yet to recover"". Unless the CPI data gets out of hand I personally don't believe we will see any tapering soon and guess what the most frequently asked question to Powell is? When does the FED start tapering? And everytime he gives the same answer and everytime the market sells off because of that. 

It would be interesting to see what all the meme stocks will do during this period of fud since especially the majority AMC is owned by us retail investors. But keep in mind that even GME and AMC can and will sell off when there is peak fud across the entire market so be careful when buying OTM calls for June 16!"

Stop asking ""When Lambo?"" and get yourself a 🚀$WEN🚀 Lambo I was inspired to look into Wendy's stock ($WEN) a few days ago after seeing [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nrqxsv/wendys_lot_of_people_getting_jacked_behind_the/) post on this sub.Here is a short list of why I think this is a good buy.

* Q1 earnings showed the beginning of their recovery from pandemic woes.
* Same store sales up 13%
* Q1 85% of dining rooms were open, Q2 should be close to 100% open.
* Q2 2020 was the hardest hit by the pandemic, Q2 2021 should be the time where recovery becomes growth, smashing yoy numbers.
* Big breakfast push, breakfast was about 3% of same store sales increase in a limited market. Target EOY is 10%.
* New and international expansion
* Consensus estimate price is around $27, its already at a discount
* $150M loaded up and ready for buy backs.
* Quarterly dividends have already recovered from pandemic slashing and should continue to grow.
* Very low volume right now. (Avg 3M shares/day)
* Scarcity: Float of 220M, Insiders own 21%, institutions own 73%. Only 6% or 13M shares available to retail, which sounds bad until you consider the next bullet point.
* Most memed company on the internet if it gains traction then, frenzy+scarcity+low volume means minimal buys could push the price quickly.

My open positions are very bullish and my plan is to accumulate shares up to about $26 before August and ride the wave on the cheap options I already own. Current open options.

FD calls: $25 strike, 6/18 exp. $0.05 price/share

Earnings calls: $28, 8/20 exp, $0.10 price/share

Edit: I posted this and instantly had to leave for work. I left one important word out of my last sentence, it should have read; ""I am NOT a financial professional DYOR and left me know what you think."" I apologize if i misled you.

MY professional background is in restaurants, I have worked everywhere from fast food to high end Italian and even one that went bankrupt last year.

It is my opinion that Wendy's is set for strong growth and significantly increased same store sales through the end of this year and into next. I know it isn't the short squeeze WSB loves so much but I think it should be a solid, worthwhile, long-term investment. And I will be buying more shares on Monday.

100,100,"AMC Volume Price Analysis Part 2   

Hey guys/girls/old apes/baby apes/tards and autists, 

For those of you following AMC daily, what a week, right? We have had some pretty intense price action out there and since I posted last week, I’ve been flooded with private messages from some of you guys wanting more information as we go along to help you understand where this market is going. Just to be clear, I am not your financial advisor and you really should invest based on your own analysis of the stock and risk tolerance. I know there is a lot of information going around out there and it can be confusing for people. Now more than ever, the use of technical tools helps us make choices not based on fear and greed, but on logic and the balance of probabilities. That being said, here is my view of the past week with AMC using volume and price as my guide.

&#x200B;

[Weekly chart](https://preview.redd.it/zn6y8j95rg371.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b2031e3bb869df44838baf462f7657da7017937)

On the weekly chart, since the breakout from the HTF (high tight flag), we have quickly reached my initial target of 63.96$. The real body of last week’s candle is longer than the previous week’s on slightly higher volume which is normal. It means Wyckoff’s law of effort and result still suggests the price action is in harmony with its associated volume. For a stock to rise, it needs effort (represented here as volume). So here we have rising price action with rising volume which is good. I am a little bit concerned about the long upper wick on this candle, though, because this suggests there is quite some selling happening here. Could be a mix of price suppression, professionals taking money off the table, and some retail booking profits/panic selling. For sure, what this long upper wick tells me is that the bears have not given up yet and we are not out of the woods. The good news here is that the heavy resistance we found at 35$ got blown out of the water on very high volume. So whatever happens, we now have VERY HIGH support at 35-36$ (resistance becomes support when broken).  

 

[Daily chart](https://preview.redd.it/ij4cvnvarg371.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=966c13ab4754a1fa66069d72fd810412c823986d)

Moving on to the daily chart, candle #1 is a very important candle. I see a very long white body with rising volume which is excellent. I want to bring your attention to candle #2. When I compare these two candles, I see that candle #1 has a way bigger body than #2 but only slightly higher volume. This tells me that bears have capitulated at these levels (35$-36$) and price could move smoothly without much resistance, which is very bullish. Keep in mind that long white candles on very high volume offer a lot of support at around half the real body if a retrace would occur (around 50$). The upper wick suggests some selling was happening here, but nothing that concerns me. Candle #3 is a black spinning top and suggests indecision by market participants. It coincided with a lot of FUD being laid out there and investors were trying to digest all the information that was being poured out by the media (by the way, trading the news is a bad idea… just saying). I like that the lower wick is longer than the upper wick which suggests more buying than selling is happening. I believe a lot of weak hands were stopped out of their positions during this day (for the newbies out there, placing your stop loss too high will most likely result in closing your positions in highly volatile stocks as you may have experienced). The spinning top closed at 51.34$, suggesting the 50$ region acted as support here. I am not surprised of this pullback because we hit around 90 on the RSI Wednesday and a lot of traders look at this indicator to book profits. Candle #4 is an inverted hammer and suggests weakness. It acts as a bearish continuation 65% of the time, but it’s really not a candle I find very reliable. Although the current price action suggests some weakness in the last 2 trading days, the good news is that the volume is dropping significantly and thus suggests this is a short-term pullback in a major uptrend (remember Wyckoff’s law of effort and result). We can confidently HOLD our long positions in this stock because the likeliest outcome is for the uptrend to resume soon once all the weak hands are weeded out of this stock. Some could argue that the start of a bull flag is being printed on the chart as well, which is good news once it breaks out to the upside.

&#x200B;

[30 minutes chart](https://preview.redd.it/pp0v8fdfrg371.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=35a0628428c149c40d1f0f5cf02bdc3396aeb234)

On the 30 minutes chart, candle #1 signals stopping volume with the long lower wick on the down candle at the 42$ region on above average volume. This short-term downtrend was stopped at the 40$ region with a hammer candle on high volume at #2. Shorter candle on higher volume suggests a lot of buying is happening at the 40$-42$ region and thus this is very strong support for us. Professionals were buying heavily here. 

&#x200B;

[60 minutes chart](https://preview.redd.it/1bwtebuirg371.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=81ebb4758f22c9c1802847d44e8f08c51aa0f8c2)

Lastly on the 60 minutes chart, we see in the last part of Thursday and Friday a small downtrend on declining volume suggesting divergence in Wyckoff’s law of effort and result. This downtrend is weak and will not last very long. For those who have not yet jumped on this rocket, you have another opportunity to hop in at an interesting price (currently around 48$). I still believe we are currently trading at a discount on AMC. For conservative traders, I see very strong support at 40-42$, but you could miss out on the rally if we do not retest this region. For those of you already strapped on your rocket ship seat, we HOLD THE LINE! This stock has A LOT more upside risk than downside risk at this point and we are merely in a small consolidation zone which is normal after a significant rally. Stocks do not trend in a straight line. During the whole week, I did NOT sell any of my call options even though they reached +1000% at some point. This is not the action of greed, but confidence that price action and volume support a lot more upside on this stock. Selling too soon is as bad as selling too late. I am so confident in this trade that I will be buying the dips next week to average up on my position AGAIN.

TLDR: Volume and price still in harmony. Buy the dips. Strong support at 40$-42$. Short-term downtrend in a major uptrend still intact. WE HOLD THE LINE!!!!

104,104,"The short-squeeze thesis isn't gonna end well for a lot of you I know this might get downvoted, but this has been on my mind for a few days, so here we go: The AMC/GME/BB/XYZ short squeeze strategy that has become prevalent in this subreddit isn't going to work out well for a lot of people.

We as humans are fascinated by asymmetrical returns, I see articles people ""Yoloing"" their life savings on these worthless stocks. Yes, the share price does rise, but don't just believe a handful of people on this subreddit are responsible for it. There are hedge funds that run quant strategies which buy and sell stocks based on momentum alone and would have possibly made a ton of money on the AMC stock price run-up. So the whole narrative that you are going to stick it to ""Hedge funds"" or ""Wall Street"" is just plain wrong.

Another thing you haven't realised is these increased share prices have only allowed company insiders to cash out on their holdings, **all at your expense**.  Don't believe me, go check it out here for yourself. You believe you are doing well saving a dying company, but you are just helping company insiders become rich.

Please always do your own DD, and please apply some common sense, it would go a long way in saving, and eventually making some money.

105,105,We are inevitable  
106,106,"Tellurian $Tell annual shareholder meeting this week and likely third deal announcement that could kick off Stage 1 LNG Export project construction! This is going to be a huge value play!! 📈 I was updating my original DD post this evening. ([Original DD Link for reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/TellurianLNG/comments/l8aspr/tellurian_tell_long_term_investment_outlook_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) After doing the math, if we have deals with similar terms such as Souki mentioned, we need one more to hit the Stage 1 benchmark. Each of the recent deals is for 3 mtpa marketing takeoff. *We have a gap of 2.5 mtpa assuming Total sticks with their agreement terms or modify's slightly as the expectation was FID by June 2021.*

One deal released a week for three weeks, leading up to the annual shareholder meeting next week. It's perfect execution on PR leading up to an all-out celebration by the leadership team. Souki can give the 🖕 to the shorts, Total for selling part of their shares, and get started with construction this summer to build out the local infrastructure, FID, and then NTP (notice to proceed) in Q1 2022 with Bechtel. 💰

I believe the next deal will be with Korea Gas Corporation (KOGAS) or Sinopec.

KOGAS has the lion's share on their market and recent tweets about South Korea, Tell CEO being appointed to South Korea / USA business council. [https://mobile.twitter.com/TellurianLNG/status/1396127896939515906](https://mobile.twitter.com/TellurianLNG/status/1396127896939515906)

Sinopec recently signed their first long-term LNG contract with Qatar Petroleum for 2 mtpa. They're actively looking to secure future energy needs.  Let's do 2.5 or 3 mtpa with Tellurian and USA to have a larger contract than Qutar.  'Murica.

**Driftwood Project Stages**

|Stage|Plants|Capacity in mtpa|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Stage 1|Plants 1 & 2|11.0|
|Stage 2|Plant 3|5.5|
|Stage 3|Plant 4|5.5|
|Stage 4|Plant 5|5.5|
|Total||27.6|

SNK’s comment brings a great perspective on takeoff with Souki’s comments on mtpa being greater than Stage 1 alone. The overflow would start conversations about Stage 2. Construction of plants 1, 2, 3  could begin together.

&#x200B;

|Project Capacity|Percent of Assets|mtpa|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Original - Tellurian|40%|12|
|Original - Equity Partners|60%|15.6|
|Likely - Tellurian|58%|16|
|Likely - Equity Partners|42%|11.5|

&#x200B;

|Partnerships|Contract Type|Capacity in mtpa|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Total|Equity partner|1|
|Total|Marketing|1.5|
|Gunvor|Marketing|3|
|Vitol|Marketing|3|
|Total as of 6/4||8.5|
|Required for Stage 1||\-11|
|Remaining as of 6/4||\-2.5|

&#x200B;

Operating Costs on FOB (free on board) forecasts were mentioned around $3.50 to the water if I recall, which could be based on the project financing provided upfront through equity partners. Since the majority of the deals are from the marketing offtake, I assume the financing for Stage 1 will need to be secured by Tellurian via loans or infrastructure programs. This self-financing could put operating costs near $4.50 mark.

Project finance could be sourced by having a foundation of long-term take contracts with investment-grade partners. They list the credit rating of parties. With the recent infrastructure bill and the government's attempts at direct access to the bond market, I wouldn’t be surprised if bond issuance or infrastructure funds was part of the equation. Project partners such as GE or Bechtel could step up in agreements to provide sourcing. The majority would be bank debt. I hope stock issuance isn't the route taken.

Driftwood Stage 1 EPC contract costs $700 per ton. Lifted to $710 to adjust for market changes in 2019. I believe 1-2% lift is an understatement with current supply cost changes. I've seen a 5% rise in labor costs alone in 2020/2021 in my industry. Short term I would push closer to the 14% rise. That would be $98. This rise might not last the entire duration of phase 1 construction. I'll guesstimate $45. $745 per ton.

|Operating Costs|$/mmBtu|
|:-|:-|
|Drilling & completion|$0.88|
|Operating|$0.36|
|Gathering, processing & transportation|$0.79|
|Contingency|$0.22|
|Liquefaction|$0.75|
|Debt|$1.50|
|Total FOB|$4.50|

**Price Targets**

$1 just in asset valuation - Acquisition of Magellan Petroleum Corporation (Haynesville Gas Production Well) is valued $400M.

2021 - March/July = $4-$10 - Deals announced gap-up (3B valuation / 409M shares). $7.34

2021 - September or FID announced = $12 - 5B in capital in (5B valuation / 409M shares) $12.22

2024 = $37 at Stage 1 Project completion (15B in valuation / 409M shares).

2025/2026/Mid-decade will see a peak in Demand/Supply pricing where LNG company's valuations could get frothy.

Future: 40% capacity equals $70 a share

Future: 100% capacity equals $120 a share

Max would be 100B valuation / 409M shares at $245. Equity partners could comprise 60% of equity that would eat into total available shares.

108,108,EXCLUSIVE: Robbing - hood exec at VC pitch meeting explaining their business  
109,109,"The Bullish Argument for SNDL - Sundial Growers 🌱☀️ Sundial Growers (SNDL) looks like a compelling buy at these levels, here’s why:

 1. They rose capital in February at $1.50 which traditionally acts as a floor for the stock.

2. Trades at 2x tangible book value compared to 12x tangible book value at cgc and acb. 

3. Had a nice high volume spike in February. It’s very common for the big mountain rise to come roughly four months after the initial molehill rise on big volume. We’re roughly 4 months from when the initial run up happened implying the Daddy run up could be near. 

4. Daily short volume remains very elevated with average daily short volume consistently around 50% although we were about 40% on Friday (which is still quite high) https://www.shortvolume.com/?t=SNDL Short interest is 13.78% as of May 14th implying shorts are shorting (selling shares they don’t own) in the morning and rebuying in the afternoon in hopes of spooking others out of their shares. This implies the short interest is quite underreported. If longs can hold strong and bring higher price action towards the end of the day these shorts are going to be overwhelmed with the sp, not to mention potential margin calls as SNDL increase it’s volatility and holding requirements. 
Once we see potentially see the automatic covering is when the party really starts 🎉

5. We had nice big volume up days of 622 million in May 28 and 894 million in June 3rd compared to Friday’s down day with only 372 million shares traded. Another bullish sign that the big volume days were also very green days while the red day was on muted volume. 

6. Stick with equity if you can. I predict the big institutions who are buying into SNDL are selling a boatload of options and ensuring the price stays under their expiration so they can collect premiums while lowering their cost basis. It’s happened the last two weeks. This can’t go on forever as the stocks price should match it’s value which imo is in the $4+ range (about 8x tangible book value) sooner rather than later. 

7. SNDL has only announced positive news and quality acquisitions since its peak in February with preferred debt and 19% equity stake in Indiva which owns many brands including the #2 gummy producer in the U.S. WANA Gummies. Sundial also acquired a large stake in The Valens at a deep discount compared to today’s price. Furthermore, SNDL acquired all of Inner Spirit which has the most retail cannabis stores in Canada at 80 stores. Sundial will undoubtedly replace current inventory with their own solidifying their strength as the only true vertical cannabis operator from growing, processing and extracting, to store front selling. As the industry continues to mature the margin increase Sundial will see is out of this world. Not to mention the free publicity from Reddit and Robinhood. For SNDL to consistently be a top 5 stock on Robinhood with a market cap of $2 billion is unheard of. The excitement around the stock will continue to help its real world performance. 

8. Sundial could very likely be acquired at any moment with 0 debt, over $1 Billion in assets including $900 million in cash. SNDL is a massive acquisition candidate at a fundamental level as it only trades at 2x book value with positive operating profit last quarter compared to CGC and acb which trade at 11x book value. 

9. As mentioned, Sundial had positive operating profits for the first time this quarter (primarily through passive security appreciation which shows no sign of stoping). If SNDL can continue the trend it will be picked up by more and more non weed hedge funds that require multiple quarters of positive operating profit before they can be incorporated. 

10. When someone buys potx or other weed etfs they automatically purchase 4.35% sundial and 5.6% of the Valens as those are the current weightings in the fund. Not to mention Indiva at a lower %. For every dollar that flows into PotX more than 10% goes to SNDL related companies. Every dollar that flows into weed funds in the future will help sundial. Imagine the money that will flow into weed companies and these funds once federal legalization is passed. 

11. The share count of 1.86 Billion is no more than Palantir or NIO which sit at 1.88 and 1.7 Billion shares, respectively.

12. SNDL currently has 4.79% institutional ownership compared to over 15% at CGC and acb. As time goes on this will continue to rise. It’s pretty normal for a developed company to have over 60%+ if not 80% institutional ownership, especially at a book value like Sundials. Book values traditionally act as a permanent floor for the stock, especially with SNDL’s positive operating profit and expected earnings growth and sales growth of 50% in 2022. 

13. The meme stock craze is not close to over. It’s just now being reported again on tv. Excitement is brewing and as normals continue and hear about it and get in, the avalanche should build higher than February’s peak. Sundial differentiates itself from the other meme stocks with it’s strong balance sheet and excitement around the up and coming industry. To me, investing in Sundial here combines level head value investing with the excitement of a new industry and the loyal meme craze. 

14. The new Sundial management team has been in place just over a year (Jan 30th, 2020) and seem to have remedied many of the operational mistakes of their predecessors (which is a main reason the stock was down from ipo price) https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/sundial-announces-departure-of-ceo-and-other-leadership-changes-and-optimization-initiatives-870988349.html 

15. They have a diversified acquisition strategy with new acquisitions in Indiva, The Valens and Inner Spirit which will lead to full vertical integration after the deals close in late summer (growing, processing/extracting and retail distribution). Sundial’s other investment holdings include: 100% ownership of Sprout Technologies, KamCan Products, 2011296 Alberta Inc, Sundial Deutschland, GmbH, Sundial Portugal, 2657408 Ontario Inc, NGBGA-BC Holdings and 50% ownership of Pathway Rx. They still have $1 Billion CAD in cash if the right opportunity comes along.

Hope some people found this background on the company helpful. Sundial seems to have a great runway to take off (fundamentally and technically) not to mention future catalysts like potentially breaking into the drinks market, as well as having many more medicinal and mental health uses. It’s undeniable that weed is losing it’s negative stigma and is way more popular in entertainment and social settings than it has ever been. Only a matter of time before you can order it at a bar or sporting event. It’s the trend of the youth and it’s just getting started. I’m here to answer any questions. Not financial advice."

114,114,"Adam Aron hidden message to us apes! Please read Hey guys. 

Hope everyone is doing well. 

Don't post much but I wanted to share something I noticed.

I think there's more of a direct hidden message from that Adam aron interview with Trey than we thought. 

I'm sure many of you seen the video of CEO Adam Aron not wearing pants on the Trey interview. 

I'm sure many of you thought this was a sign of the naked shorts and from what may or may not be a picture on the floor of someone on the moon. 

But I think there's more.

After watching this clip several times it seems to me Mr.Aron intentionally exposed himself knowing we apes would catch onto this message.

Hear me out.

Analyzing the position of the camera you can see that it's tilted upward facing him. So the phone would be on an angle to some degree. It would be leaning against something. 

Now if you analyze how the phone fell youll see that that camera fell toward him. If the camera was leaning it would've fallen backwards not forwards. Unless something either pulled the bottom of the phone causing it to fall forward or something pushing the top forwards. 

Now if you watch the interview the phone camera that he's using is steady throughout the discussion. The table or phone doesn't wobble or seem shaky. 

If you look at where he's seated he's not close to the table or under the table near the legs. Even if he was and hit the table causing it to shake the phone would've fallen backwards not forwards. Try it yourself lean your camera on a table and file yourself with the same angle. Youll see what I mean. 

You can see that he talks with his hands alot in the interview with them being visible alot. But for that brief moment that that camera falls over it looks like him maybe grabbed something and pulled it causing the phone to fall forward and then grabbing it he lifted it up facing him. 

He knew that he wasn't wearing pants. Anyone thats in that situation would be very conscious of not exposing himself that way but the way he picks up the camera he fully exposes himself (imo intentionally) again to send a message to us.


He didn't seem embarrassed or conscious about it at all. Even the way he was speaking you can kinda tell that he knew this was gunna happen. Listen to him mid sentence. He doesn't stop and be like oops sorry guys. My bad my phone fell. None of the surprise or shock factor. 


I might be over analyzing this but naturally as someone who practices law and plays poker professionally I can be very analytical. Maybe over doing it in this situation but I wanted to get others point of view. 

I think he had something under or around the base of his phone and he pulled the string ,cord, tie or whatever from under the table which would go up through the back thus causing it to pull the base of the phone backwards causing the phone to fall forward and expose himself. 


Lmk what you guys think?

115,115,"High SI, Fundamentally Undervalued & An Interesting Healthcare Revolution? TLDR: This company has a high short interest that is only continuing to increase according to [Ortex](https://public.ortex.com/) along with a days to cover that has essentially tripled in the last week alone. Fundamentally they are better now than ever before yet are trading at more than a 60% premium from ATHs. Shorts have hammered the stock, and I think an opportunity may have presented itself, if you all agree?

TLDR for the TLDR: This stock is good and has a higher SI than BB and has an extremely auspicious (likely to succeed) business model with innovations that guarantee and justify a price target that is nearly 4x the current share price by EOY.

(Where I got all this info will be listed)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

High SI -

Of the shares outstanding the short interest of this stock is 36M shares, 13.12% per the last settlement date, May 14th, BUT the estimated short interest according to Ortex is now 42M shares, a fairly substantial increase from the current (as of last publication) 36M short interest.

Days to cover has increased from the 1s to now 3.32 in just a few days. Which is good because it means if a run-up were to happen then the shorts would have a hard time exiting their position, making a short squeeze more auspicious.

According to [Fintel.io](https://fintel.io/), the short share availability has only decreased and stayed today, indicating that very few shorts have covered today even with the price up significantly. This is because the less short shares the brokers have to lend out, the higher amount of short shares that have already been lent out, meaning that the people those short shares have been lent out to have not covered given that the short share availability has done nothing but go down and sideways all of Friday.

Not only does this stock have a high SI but it has increased recently, meaning a squeeze opportunity may be perfectly aligning.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Fundamentally Undervalued -

Most high growth stocks have gotten obliterated since February 16th and this one is no different in that regard. However the fundamentals of this company have only exponentially increased with essentially zero price action reaction.

There is proven manipulation in this stock's price action (imo). Just to name a few of the catalysts the price action practically utterly ignored (ALL of these were after February 16-the peak of high growth); 2 revenue beats, 1 EPS beat, CEO and 3 C-suite members getting LEAPS with share exercisability valuing in the hundreds of millions WITH an exercise price of $7.83 which is ABOVE the current and then stock price, announcement of 5 studies that in the company's own words would act as important marketing events that would likely lead to increased sales, CFO projection of 'substantial double-digit revenue growth' along with his 20-40% YOY operating expense increase projection for the 'next few years' (According to own company estimates as far as sales and adoption profitability chances based on their numbers are likely to come at least one year before analysts are projection ((imo)), MORE bullish insider transactions in the form of the CMO picking up more LEAPS after her original one mentioned above, CEO and COO being awarded tens of millions of dollars in profit in the form of hundreds of thousands of shares 840k to be exact and as of now they have not sold any, new EXTREMELY innovative product confirmation-nanonozzle (imo), added to MSCI index, confirmation of several large sales, several studies proving 100% concordance and increased accuracy of their main product compared to 'gold standard' of the market this company is trying to disrupt, HUGE institutional ownership increase, from around 4-5% at lows up to 15.60% currently.

[This document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12jAjUCFcVm7447LKvB4gQPg2BRT-1SxILV_2jNXpxB8/edit?usp=sharing) explains more in depth why this company is extremely fundamentally undervalued and WILL do great things in the future.

Interesting Healthcare Revolution -

A higher life expectancy for everyone in the aggregate along with a better quality of life is what would happen should their goal of 'global Sap\*\*\* adoption be effectuated. 'Chemotherapeutic drug enhancements' is one of many of the revolutions that we could see specifically because of what this company does. Paraphrasing the CEO, 'we believe that the next big wave of innovation in Biology will derive from optical genome mapping', which is what **Bio-na-no Geno-mi-cs, $B-N-G-O**'s Saphyr does-optical genome mapping, and they do it better than anyone. According to the company itself, >500bp detection in SVs with Saphyr compared to the CMA, FISH, and KT competition is cost effective, requires less hands on time, and has a faster turnaround time. Not to mention it has more accurate readings and has less false positives. LOH and SNV detection are said to be in the works, currently zero of the three competing methods can detect these. Nor can FISH, CMA, or KT detect the wide range of variant classes Saphyr can.

With this knowledge, one *wonders* why Saphyr has not already been adopted in all 2,500 cytogenetic labs, most of this can be attributed to resistance of change and relatively low academic praise and exposure of Saphyr's capabilities, but with FIVE large clinical studies in the works on NIPT, postnatal screening, hematological malignancies in leukemia and lymphomas, and solid tumor research, that is sure to change all in due time. Not to mention cost per genome reducing from $450-$550 currently to $100 by at maximum 2023 (Saphyr is already cost effective, just imagine how cheap it will be compared to other methods once the price more than halves per genome). Throughput to increase by 14x from the already immense maximum of 5000 genomes per year with the current Saphyr system. Throw in in the nanonozzle release that 'may' include SNV detection and will 'fill in the gaps of what current NGS is missing', and one has a strong case to make that this company will revolutionize healthcare and the entire genomic sector as we know it.

I plan on yoloing another 10k shares in $B-N-G-O by EOY at the latest.

I will not sell anything for years. I am hodling regardless of what market headwinds come to fruition, in my mind the company will do great things but it is hard to predict when they drop PR and harder to predict when other people will react to it. There is a short squeeze on the horizon and I believe >$10 is the true current fundamental value of the company easily.

If my fellow retards want to burn the shorts of **$B-N-G-O** then I will lead the charge by yoloing in the rest of the current BP in my account-enough for about 300-400 more shares.

There IS a short squeeze on the horizon and I am willing to hodl with diamond hands for however long it takes. If WSB were to agree then I think I have an idea of [what may happen-](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nlua3m/the_fellowship_of_the_saphyr/)

LMK what y'all think - is 🚀 $B-N-G-O 🚀 next up?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Need to know terms-

Nanonozzle - innovations or product that would enable 'sequencing capabilities' along with ('maybe') single nucleotide variant detection. Basically when this releases (we don't know when) the stock price will probably go up anywhere from 30%-500% depending on how innovative it is and how much it makes NGS obsolete, which is what the C-suite has implied it will do.

NGS - next generation sequencing, competition with OGM.

OGM - optical genome mapping, what $B-N-G-O's main product -the Saphyr- does.

116,116,"Work Horse DD **With the growing talk about a potential Work Horse short squeeze I looked into the company and here's what I think about it, and why I bought: TLDR at bottom**

&#x200B;

There is a TLDR after each section for more in depth details. Or a very broad TLDR at end.

# The Drone (CON)

1. ""Horse Fly"" is Work Horses last mile delivery drone launched from their delivery vehicle. Sounds great in theory and this is exactly what we expected the future to hold, right? Sure. As a consumer though do you really want your package to be dropped in your [front yard](https://youtu.be/05BaPqBXNT0?t=207) and have to walk to pick up your package or have a person put in literally in front of your door? A loud drone is also a huge ""HEY COME STEAL MY PACKAGE"" alarm.
   1. ""Horse Fly"" Me, the OP, being a student Pilot, I knew about airspaces and can Horse Fly even fly in the majority of US Airspace? Turns out they actually can, they claim on their website they have worked with the FAA to obtain permission which is a major PRO. As stated on their website: **""The HorseFly system is designed to conform to the FAA guidelines for UAV operation in the U.S. ""**
      1. However, you cannot really use this system in any densely populated area (like new york) for the simple fact you don't want drones flying around 10lb packages above thousands of humans heads all day. That's a lawsuit begging to happen.
2. The drone is limited to a 10lb payload, this even further reduces the actual amount of packagesit will be able to deliver. Ultimately this drone is pretty fucking useless as it's only use is in very sparsely populated areas or small suburban areas.

(1) **Tl;dr:**

The drones cannot be utilized everywhere in the USA, which greatly restricts their abilities considering the [majority of the US population lives in just a few different locations](http://ecpmlangues.u-strasbg.fr/civilization/geography/maps/US%20Population%20density,%202010.png) anywhere dark red would likely be unable for this drone. Drones are maintenance heavy and seem to still require human intervention. I just cant see the ultimate viability of drones compared to a human. Would be loud and attract thieves, and annoy customers.

# Continued Revenue (CON)

2.How will Work Horse continue to make money after i.e UPS buys all the trucks they want? Obviously UPS is not interested in buying the newest model every year, which means no new revenue for Work Horse. So what about maintenance? It appears as though Work Horse contracts out maintenance through Ryder Systems. [https://ryder.com/locations](https://ryder.com/locations). This would imply Work Horse will not be making money from maintenance.

1. Drone Maintenance? I haven't found anything on their website about this, but would it really be worth it for UPS to have to be constantly shipping these drones back to Work Horse for repairs and needing to keep extra drones on hand and constantly accessible? Or just pay a driver who is significantly more reliable?

&#x200B;

(2) **Tl;dr:**

Theres **no real potential for continued revenue** after workhorse sells a company their initial fleet, workhorse wont be the ones doing maintenance and the customer company wont be interested in a new fleet of the newest model each year.

&#x200B;

# Charging Costs (CON)

[reuters.com](https://reuters.com) Did an article about workhorse charging costs. **""Developing the battery plants and charging infrastructure to fund an electrified global vehicle fleet could require an investment of $2.7 trillion by manufacturers and governments "".**  Workhorse does not have anywhere near the required capital to build charging stations, which would likely leave the cost for UPS to cover. Not to mention EV doesn't change a god damn thing, we will create the electricity for the EV's by burning coal LOL [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ups-workhorse-group-electric-vehicles/ups-workhorse-electric-van-deal-shows-progress-on-charging-costs-idUSKCN1G61RZ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ups-workhorse-group-electric-vehicles/ups-workhorse-electric-van-deal-shows-progress-on-charging-costs-idUSKCN1G61RZ)

(3) T**l;dr** Infrastructure required will likely be so significantly expensive that the cost would never be recouped over any realistic time frame from the money being saved between electricity and petroleum costs by a customer company (like UPS). Besides, electricity on this size scale will be significantly more expensive than petroleum which just means you're consistently losing money by switching to an EV fleet.

&#x200B;

# Why Q4 FY 2020 Was so high (CON)

"" **Sales for the fourth quarter of 2020 were recorded at $652,000 compared to $3,000 in the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase in sales was due to a higher volume of trucks produced and delivered.** "" [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/01/2184359/0/en/Workhorse-Group-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Results.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/01/2184359/0/en/Workhorse-Group-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Results.html). The majority of this large increase was actually due to an investment workhorse made in $RIDE. The only quarters that will generate a profit is those that WKHS made a good investment or sold vehicles, they have no recurring or stable revenue source.

&#x200B;

# The MOASS (MAJOR PRO)

This stock has a huge potential for the Mother of All Short Squeezes. From [marketbeat.com](https://marketbeat.com) they claim 38.5% of workhorses shares are shorted. This is massive, and literally we just caught the shorts with their [pants down](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ns4bqz/amc_ceo_shows_us_he_isnt_wearing_pants/).

&#x200B;

# So why the fuck did you buy it then?

I bought it for the squeeze. WKHS Can gain a lot of potential with a larger capital if a squeeze were to occur.

&#x200B;

# Overall TL;DR:

Workhorse is a shit company in the long term and will never be able to scale appropriately given their current capital, but the short-term short squeeze could provide capital to allow for workhorse to build their own maintenance shops, charging stations, and dealerships around the US which will provide a stable revenue source. Currently they don't stand a chance against Amazon.

**TL;DR OF THE TL;DR:**

Company shit, short squeeze good.

118,118,"Cum rights, and how they can be very useful For those unaware, [Cum rights](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cumrights.asp) (or ""with"" rights) allow a shareholder of record to subscribe to a rights offering declared by a company. Owners of shares that have cum rights are thus able to buy new shares in a secondary offering, typically at a price lower than the current market price of the shares in question. Furthermore, the rights themselves have value apart from the value of the existing shares.

These often come with a cum bonus which describes a share that designates the purchaser the right to receive the current bonus when this bonus occurs; the overall number of shares in the market increases. A cum bonus represents the good health of a stock, making it easier to buy and sell.

I think it's very important that new investors are aware of their options when it comes to buying stocks they like. I'm sure some of you already know about cum rights, and I'm sure quite a few of you have already recieved a cum bonus (If you've bought SPY puts recently, you've probably already recieved this). We're in an era where new investors can get an upper hand on the market, and cum rights are really the best way to blow your way to the top."

120,120,"$WDC Western Digital is being driven up by Chia and earnings prospects $WDC has good growth prospects due to a surge in HDD demand, and good earnings prospects.

Chia uses spare storage space on hard drives to verify transactions. This is considered to be the 'green' alternative to ASIC and GPUs. 

- Increased HDD demand:

Chia has gone up massively in recent months, driving a rush to purchase hard drives in order to mine it. As such, there have been hard drive shortages recently due to the increased demand. Much like GPU and semi-conductor stocks, we can expect good price action (and have already seen it) for hard drive manufacturer stocks. 

' ""In recent weeks the demand and pricing for high capacity [hard disk drives, or HDDs] has seen a material step higher ... and enterprise [solid state drive, or SSD] prices have also moved higher,"" analysts at Bank of America wrote in a Thursday report. The ""primary upside driver"" for that rising demand, according to BofA: chia. '

Western Digital is a market leader in the production of HDD's, producing some of the highest quality hard drives that have the best life expectancy, and a good warranty. As Chia transactions are very taxing on HDD's, buyers will be looking for the most durable hard drives. Which is why I am focusing my attention on Western Digital versus another stock such as Seagate. Western Digital is probably the best known manufacturer of hard drives, and usually a top choice for consumers. 

- Earnings:

Western Digital is also an attractive pick due to it's earnings outlook. Analysts are still raising their earnings estimates for the company. The growing optimism on earnings prospects are driving estimates higher, which should get reflected in its stock price.

Earnings estimates for the next quarter and full year are increasingly being driven higher and higher. The company is likely to earn $1.46 per share for the current quarter, representing a change of +18.7%. Two estimates have moved higher in the past 30 days. For the full year, the company is expected to earn $3.83 per share, +25.99% over last year.  


The stock has gained more than 12% over the past four weeks. As earnings growth and the Chia frenzy are both likely to drive the stock higher -  in my opinion, it is a good buy, and I have added it to my portfolio."

I instantly realized after seeing this that big business and the government don't consider pirates real threats anymore. There are cargo ships parked all over the damn place just waiting for a pirate with the RPG I bought him to take. This was my first confirmation bias. Which is why I knew I had to find a way to buy in.

I then turned to the only place I knew that could help me find out more about how to invest in the next Benjamin Hornigold:

It didn't work. However, after a few more days of digging around googling autistic keywords, I found it:

**Bingo.**

Disclaimer before I go any further: You might be thinking to yourself, ""wow what a prick. Who would invest and give guns to people who you pretty much know are going to use them on other humans? What kind of sick person would do such a thing?""

So - with the ethics/DD taken care of, I began my Journey to find a way to get some pirates invested in.

# Part 2: Actually finding the pirate stonk exchange

Not gonna lie - this was a pain in the ass. Turns out, the only way to actually invest in pirates is to give them the money/guns physically. My Wendy's check didn't give me enough for an air plane ticket and to invest so instead I decided to just buy the RPGs and send em out to them.

I got in contact with a guy who called himself '3 leg' off a site im pretty sure I cant post on here and sent him an email asking if they had any stock I could buy in their pirate crew (and how many shares I would get for sending over an RPG).

&#x200B;

So, I bought 3 RPG-7's from places unknown and sent them off to Jowlo Road.

It has currently been about 5 months now since I sent the original 3 RPG's. The only contact I have received from 3 leg was some weird email in Somali:

# Part 3: Current Day

So here we are, almost 6 months down the line - no money left in my bank account and no word from 3 leg. I'm starting to think something might have happened to them while they were out at sea and am worried. 3 leg, from what I knew, was a pretty stand up guy. He replied fast to my emails and was quick to send me an address. It makes me think the RPG's might not have been enough. I am saving up currently to make a trip out to Hardaheere (the town he lives in) to make sure they are okay and to hopefully find the tendieman too. Will report back if I make any headway.

130,130,"Any thoughts on WOOF? WOOF stock currently has 33% of short interest as a percentage of free float. However, considering the company’s growth outlook, the stock looks primed for a squeeze.

For Q1 2021, the company reported revenue growth of 27% to $1.4 billion. For the same period, the company acquired 1.2 million new net customers. This was the third consecutive quarter where more than one million customers were acquired.

It’s also worth noting that the market for pet care was worth $109 billion for FY2020. Over the next five years, the market size is expected to increase to $157 billion. Therefore, there is a big addressable market and this is likely to ensure that healthy growth sustains.

From a financial perspective, the company [reported a positive free cash flow of $68 million](https://ir.petco.com/static-files/8bdadd25-38b8-4469-81f4-7b75f73aa355) for Q1 2021. For the comparable period last year, FCF was negative.

With positive FCF, the company is well-positioned to deleverage. Another important point to note is that the company’s [comparable sales increased by 28% in Q1 2021](https://ir.petco.com/static-files/00b6a6e5-47ad-48e3-a13c-699dfce70beb). If comparable sales growth remains strong, it’s likely that EBITDA margin will continue to improve."

\- Currently, the rumor is legalization at the federal level in the US at some point soon

\- This could be a massive catalyst for the entire cannabis sector

\- 200M share float with 40M short = a potential squeeze

\- $2B Market Cap compared to Tilray with $8B

\- Last week implied volatility jumped around 10% in option calls signaling a move is being priced in

\- Whales likely have been accumulating at these levels for the past year showing a sideways range

\- The company has cleaned up and made executive level changes while shares dropped -90% +

140,140,"WELL Health Technologies has every ingredient for a short squeeze With all of the CLOV hype, I've seen WELL Health Technologies (WELL) thrown around as another potential play. Both companies are billionaire-backed and are leading the healthcare game but I think WELL not only outperforms it fundamentally but they seem to have every component needed for a face-ripping short squeeze. WELL has been consolidating for roughly 9 months in a very similar fashion to its 2019 consolidation period before it took off from just under CAD $2.00 to just under CAD $10.00 in less than a year. The On Balance Volume Indicator (OBV) measures cumulative volume action. Similar to the November/ December 2020 bottoming pattern, a rising OBV tends to come prior to bullish price reversals by demonstrating that the stock is under accumulation.

Over the past 6-weeks, short-term Momentum Indicators such as the RSI & MACD have been recovering and are on the verge of reclaiming bullish territory. In addition, further confirmation that momentum is positioning to provide underlying support for a price breakout above the 3.5-month downtrend at $7.00 is the Buy signal recently established by the MACD indicator.  
More importantly...   
\- short interest has increased from 1.2mm shares to almost 5.00mm shares at an average of $7.17 per share representing a $35M short position.  
\- shares available to short have decreased from 3.4mm to only 1.9mm meaning the cost to borrow is getting significantly higher, while the available shares to short is significantly decreasing.  
This is literally the same fundamental reason we saw short squeezes in AMC, GME, and many other names. Could WELL Health be next?  
I think this, in parallel with a US IPO onto the NASDAQ with Fenwick & West is lining up WELL for what could be a face-ripping short squeeze..."

Dick’s (DKS) recently reported earnings, smashing estimates moving the stock price ~17% from $84 to $98.

2.     Rated Strong Buy or Buy of the Nine Brokerages covering the firm – in the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 75.8%. Earned Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

3.     Unique Market Position – Their BM locations are all located within the South/Mid-West. Think early re-opening/less restrictions/ etc. They also have a large assortment of Guns/Ammo that is more serviceable than other competitors. They offer value, with a wide product assortment which has helped them gain market share.

4.     Recently reduced its loan obligation by $99 million, and increased its issuer-credit rating from B to B +

# Positions

* 500 shares @ $32.60
* 40 6/18 35C

# Bull case

1. $ASO  paid off 25% of its debt in Q1 ahead of schedule (they announced last  week), which suggests they had incredible free cash flow.  That's Ken  Hicks doing what he said he'd do this year - pay down debt.  $ASO has \~$700M LTD (compared to DKS at \~$400M).    The nice thing here - there's HUGE free cash flow, so they can buy   back shares, pay down debt, and still meet aggressive EPS goals. This  increased issuer-credit rating from B to B+.
2. ALL their peers crushed earnings. All the shit they sell are flying off the shelves. Sports in the south are full go.
3. [U.S. judge overturns California’s ban on assault weapons](https://apnews.com/article/california-gun-politics-government-and-politics-3d72caa3b52667b2a450cae41a087468)  \-  record 39.6M background checks and 22M gun sales (8M 1st time  buyers),  and the record pace to date in 2021 pretty much tells the  story.  Not that some of us wouldn't want to get back to pennies per  round... like the good old days of 2019.  CEO said he would like to have  about $70M   more in guns&ammo inventory, but can't get their hands on it (the  analyst interview about 2 weeks ago).  G&A could be a tailwind or  headwind,  depending on what scenario develops - a good thing to  understand.
4. Shorts exited and reduced exposure but short interest is still **\~22.59%**. Float **$55.59M**

Bear case

1. I  haven’t seen any analyst bearish and we cannot underestimate MM ability  to keep this down, especially KKR who brought $ASO public. Some say  that selling has likely been what has been suppressing the price after  surges in value. Sales are expected to decrease next year, which would   bring the multiple up or the stock down is the only mid term negative I  see.  A press release last week showed total KKR ownership below 40%.   They last sold 14 million shares on 5/5.
2. Some  say $ASO may no longer be a comparative slam dunk - alot has changed  the past few months... e.g. all are in the 10 P/E range now, and $ASO's  significant LT debt gap won't get fixed overnight.

147,147,"E-Commerce stocks Fundamental & Comps Analysis || Price targets included **I own EBAY stock. This report is purely for entertainment purposes and should not be considered investment advice. Do your own research and due diligence.**

Hello again, everyone.

After my [analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/nhhov7/cruise_ship_stocks_fundamental_comps_analysis/) of cruise ship stocks, it was refreshing to pour through companies with such strong financials. However, with healthy income statements and balance sheets come high, perhaps overly optimistic valuations. I expected that the stock price of most of these companies would be completely divorced from their near-future expected financials, and I was mostly correct, but there are still a couple of buying opportunities I am excited to share.

After analyzing a list of some of the strongest e-commerce players in the world, I found 2 companies where I believed there is a value opportunity: Alibaba and eBay.

I had expected any Alibaba buying opportunity to have been completely swallowed given that every analysis, comment, and post I see about the stock is centered around how now is a great time to buy and how many institutions are buying, but the stock is still at a level where I would consider buying.

The opportunity which suits me and my portfolio better, and the one which I have provided some additional DD on is, eBay. I won't spoil too much, but I was really excited to dive into this company, and everything I found made me lean more into buying. I was able to discover what I consider to be compelling evidence that the company is undervalued, why the stock is undervalued, and reason to believe that the price will rise to fair value in the near-term. I made a purchase of eBay stock after my research, and I do not own any of the other companies listed. I purchased the stock at the beginning of the week, and it has had a fortunate run-up since then, but the difference between the price today and my fair value estimate, $65 -> $71 does not hit as hard as $60 ->71.

A quick note on my DD. I don't often put this sort of research down on paper, so this is halfway (at most) between a competent report and stream-of-consciousness research. If I wanted to look into something, I went and did it, then took down the notes and worried about formatting almost not at all. If anything is unclear, spelled wrong, or doesn't make sense, let me know and I'll go edit. I did some editing of course, but I might've missed something!

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S8SRRHtQ4HTdZydy83yYbz-b1CqNUeqiVJObXIawIKQ/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S8SRRHtQ4HTdZydy83yYbz-b1CqNUeqiVJObXIawIKQ/edit?usp=sharing)

**Methodology**:

* Created a three-statement model for Alibaba Group Holding Limited, Shopify Inc., Amazon. com Inc., JD .com Inc., Sea Limited, MercadoLibre Inc., eBay Inc., and Walmart Inc.,
* Combined these with a WACC build-up to create an unlevered DCF and derived a fair-value-per-share estimate using a growth in perpetuity and an exit EBITDA multiple approach
* Spread comparable companies (the companies listeD)
* Combined results from DCF and select comps valuations to arrive at fair value estimates

**How to use the model**

* Anywhere you see blue text is OK to edit, and should not result in breaking anything. Green text = taken from another worksheet, so if you want to change one of those cells I recommend following the trail first
* To make meaningful changes to the 3-statement-model, scroll to the bottom of each ""Financials"" page to tweak assumptions about revenue growth, GPM, and other assumptions. You can also adjust the specifics for each case scenario from here
* I have tried to supply useful assumptions about terminal growth rates and exit EBITDA multiples in the DCF models. Feel free to adjust as needed, keeping in mind the model is very sensitive to these inputs
* WACC buildup can be done however you want. If you have access to a Bloomberg terminal you can get a better adjusted beta than I used, and a more precise cost of debt (more on that below), or you can just use the override cell to put in a WACC% directly
* Trading Comps Input essentially works to arrive at normalized multiples before converting to an output. Do not be intimidated by non-Gaap disclosures. Everything here is available on annual reports, quarterly reports, and press releases.
* For trading comps outputs, simply toggle the companies in column B until you have the company you wish to analyze in the first position, and the other comps below it, then head to Valuation Matrix to see the results.
* Feel free to adjust the assumptions, there are a lot of them
* If you can think of an assumption better than something I have here, or if you spot a mistake let me know!

**Other Notes:**

* Some of these companies have assumptions that I have baked in which should be scrutinized. I would highly recommend against jumping straight to the DCF/val matrix and instead take some time to adjust the assumptions. You may not agree with my findings and theses (plural for thesis?) so play safe!
* The 2 irl people I showed my work to asked me to rank the companies in order of which stocks I like the most. For me, the value-based & forward-looking rankings are 1. EBAY 2. BABA 3.AMZN 4. WMT 5. SHOP 6. JD 7. SE 8. MELI
* JMIA was considered for the list, but the financials the company publishes are lacking in depth, and I get a little squeamish when a company has ""technologies"" in its name, so I let it go. Jumia is a very interesting company though, worth looking into if you're not afraid of some sovereign/political risk.
* MELI appears to have a shorter payables turnover than receivables. Thumbs down.
* I Imported the model from excel to Google Sheets before sharing, so if something is broken, let me know so I can go in and fix it ASAP
* Used 10Y YTM bond data on FINRA when possible to arrive at assumptions for cost-of-debt used in WACC build-up. If you have access to a bloomberg terminal you can grab the bond with the best volume and use that.
* I apologize for ambiguity (especially on the non-gaap stuff) but I couldn't figure out how to remove my name from the comments quickly (if you know how to do this, other than going one-by-one through each comment, let me know and I'll reupload). Most comments were simply memos to myself to remember what each cell consists of beyond the label (i.e., components of ""other current assets"")
* A thousand more things. If you want to know just ask.

Ill try to put it as down to the point as I can. If you dont want to read - there is illustrative picture for you.

Tellurian, the new gas giant in our solar system has recently finished two contracts...

* Their 2019 revenue was 28,77 million.
* May 27 - Tellurian and Gunvor Sign 10-year LNG Agreement for 3 mtpa ( 12b + 1.2b yearly revenue )
* June 3 - Tellurian and Vitol sign 10-year LNG agreement for 3 mtpa ( 12b + 1.2b yearly revenue )
* 12b + 12b = 24b ( 2.4b yearly for next 10 years )
* Their market cap is still sitting at 2.05b
* 2.4b / 28,77m = 83x ed revenue in 10 day span,  their market cap only multiplied to 2-3 from already depressed prices, not even reaching precovid valuation - drastically lowering their p/e.
* 2.4b yearly for 10 years, is fairly safe spot to develop their new Driftwood LNG facility
* Profit (?)

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Thinks to consider:**

*  \- This revenue is based on ability to develop 20b plant - that is set to start building in Q1 2022
*  \+ Charif Souki is founder of Cheniere - I and other investors will see this as proven ability to get funding for that plant.
*  \+ Once the plant is done, value of the company increases by 1100% by the value of assets alone...

150,150,"Can I get an explanation of the short term play that everyone is going on about for BB I asked this in the weekend disc but didn't get any solid explanations. So, as a long term growth stock I can understand since it's moving towards being a software company. What I am not understanding is the **short term** play that everyone is trying to get in on and am misunderstanding something?

If the stock was shorted at 10% of the float (55m) as of yesterday and saw the premarket jump from 15.25 to 20.04 with 30mil of volume then drops to 16.4 with no resistance, wouldn't that indicate whoever short sold prior to 6/3 likely covered in the premarket?As the price has been steadily dropping through out the week, wouldn't new short positions indicated by daily short ratio increasing likely transitory and also likely to have been covering within the high volume as it trends down throughout the day?The short borrow fee rate is currently at 0.41% which means if a short seller didn't cover within the past few days, couldn't they just wait it out as it costs so little?Some one mentioned in the other thread that it could gamma squeeze but looking at the OI for next week, the open interest from $13 and 18.50 strike is only 4.6m shares which makes up like 1% of the float.  
Edit: formatted so easier to read  
Edit 2: 15 hours in and the only short play (why do people keep commenting about the long play) that's been described (minus the stuff not supported by any data) is hype buying.  
Edit 3: Someone posted a fintel link saying it's shorted at 24% but that's *daily short volume ratio which is completely different*."
151,151,"$WOOF - Big Brain Play I think WOOF boasts very attractive upside potential with limited downside risk. If you disagree lmk why. I'm genuinely interested to know why I shouldn't have thrown half my money into this stock (I just started investing so its literally nothing - just a few grand in the Roth).

**Brief Overview:**

*The Financials*

WOOF is Petco. It is currently trading at $22.09, market cap of 5 Billion, and an 3month avg trading volume of 2.58 million and a 10 day avg trading volume of 6.17 million. In spite of Covid-19 they did $4.43B in revenue which is a slight increase from $4.39B in 2019.  First quarter of 2021 they did $1.41B. If the keep around the same performance for the rest of the year that will lead to revenues in 2021 to be around $5.6B. The Enterprise Value/EBITDA of WOOF is 27.66. But Earnings are increasing for 2021.

*The Company*

The company is making a switch from focusing on pet goods and food towards pet health and wellness. This means they are expanding to a more subscription based revenue model. They are offering deals by bundling grooming and vet-care services. They put a lot of work into their website and becoming more digital. Also they are using their brick and mortar locations as micro-distribution points. Yahoo analyst ratings are from $22-$31.

**My Reasoning for Bullish Sentiment:**

1. 3 Month Bullish Trend
2. High Institutional Ownership at 55.03%
3. Impressive Financial Success/analyst upgrades/Bullish price targets
4. Possibility of a Short Squeeze
5. Low Risk because the company is already being low-balled

I know Short Squeeze gets thrown around a lot but Im saying it based off of the numbers. The NASDAQ releases information on the short interest on stocks 2 times a month. The last reported date was May 15th. At that point in time the Short Float was around 17 million shares (an increase from the previous report) and the days to cover was 16.1. Currently the volume is way up but the price dropped indicating a sell off. Im not too sure how to interpret this in terms of which direction the short interest is likely moving in. But in a couple of days the NASDAQ will release the latest Short Interest Data. Im mainly bullish on the company, the possibility of the squeeze is just extra.

I tried to keep the post as close to facts as possible and limit my bias as best as I could. I invested in WOOF because I liked the growth potential from a Momentum/Technical Viewpoint and the Fundamentals gave me assurance in limited downside risk.

My Weakness is definitely understanding and analyzing capital structures. So any extra insight into the debt analysis and such would be helpful.

158,158,"What do you think about Fisker? Fisker is an American electric car manufacturer. The respected auto designer-turned-innovative carmaker is preparing for the 2022 rollout of the Ocean, the first model from Manhattan Beach-based EV company Fisker Inc.  
It’s the second business venture created by Fisker, who launched Fisker Automotive in 2007 and brought to market the Fisker Karma, a luxury plug-in hybrid sports sedan. He resigned from the company in 2013, and it was sold in a bankruptcy auction.  
   
Fisker is using that initial startup experience to plan the route for his new company while also drawing on his decades of automotive knowledge.  
   
The Danish icon got his start in Munich at BMW, where he designed the Z8 roadster James Bond drove in the “The World Is Not Enough.” His next gig was at Aston Martin, where his credits include the DB9 and the V8 Vantage. He launched Fisker Inc. in 2016, and the company went public in October with a market cap of about $3 billion.  
   
In an interview with the Business Journal, Fisker talked about learning from his failures, securing unique manufacturing deals and shaking up the auto industry.

Henrik Fisker is quoted saying, “I’m probably the only one next to Elon Musk that actually has started a car company and put the car on the road. We’re on target to start manufacturing and deliver our vehicle in fourth quarter of next year.”"

When GME closed at 325, down from its ATH of 485, all of the ""apes"" on here were grasping at increasingly frail straws to tell themselves the everything was gonna be fine and the moon was their next stop, and then GME dipped below $50 by February 4th? Is it just me? 

Both AMC and GME peaked at/near $35 billion market cap midweek, then had a lot of action into slow bleeds to close the week at around 23 billion. Almost identical sorts of price action, as well as eerily similar volumes and the first round of panic selling before the halts. What do we think in terms of realistic price targets for AMC? Low of $15, closing EOW at around 20? Lower?"
162,162,"Current Price Action of GME is shockingly similar to the past two major run-ups and 'micro squeezes'. Also T+35/T+21 elaboration. I'll start with the usual: I am not a financial advisor.  I do not provide financial advice! Everything following this is opinion/observation.  Much of my knowledge of the markets has been acquired through reading countless hours of DD posted by others.

OBLIGATORY - BuY & HoDl!

Now that that is out of the way, I would like to reference a few authors and their inspired DD that helped get me to this point.  The below have DD's that are a must read if you have not already; please visit their profiles and read their posts.  I will attempt to summarize the main points briefly below.

u/Criand:

[1)]**The flurry of rules before the storm. GME might be hitting T+35 and T+21 next week**

[2)]**Things are shockingly similar to the February 24th and March 10th runup**

u/myplayprofile - I am highlighting just one of their posts, but it goes into linear correlation which is now shifting to logarithmic correlation between GME & AMC prices.  AND he explains how there is the possibility that AMC is being used by hedgefucks to hedge their GME losses.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

This post is focused on u/Criand's DD, which enlightened me and many others as to what the fuck has been going on with the 21 day / 31 day FTD cycles.

Basically his DD over the last few weeks is the most accurate hypothesis that we have to date regarding the FTD cycles, and one of his most recent posts shows how this theory is now supported by the price action seen on May 25th and in the following days.

Key Points:

* He clarifies the confusion around why the standalone T+21 day FTD cycles, which have been shown to cause price surges, do not act the same way as they did during the $480 run and the $350 run.
* Explains how the Feb-March $350 run was caused by a dual event of T+35 & T+21 day FTD cycles occurring in close proximity to one another (back to back trading days)
* Notes that the Feb 24th initiation of the run up to $350 was exactly 10 days before we peaked at $350
* He references u/yelyah2 DD, which shows how gamma neutral spikes on day 1 of the $480 and $350 price run ups, returns to normal for about a week, and then spikes up massively again, initiating the January and February Gamma Squeezes

Below is my furtherment of u/Criand's work all in one concise graphic which feels oddly like a child to me right now.  Not sure if that is just because I have not really written any DD's before.

Please click the image to view it blown up and actually take in what is being laid out for you with my lovely computer crayons which I swear to god I don't eat... EVER.

[Transparent boxes represent the initiation of the combined T+35 \/ T+21 day price movements + 6 days \(because it has only been 6 trading days since ](https://preview.redd.it/v8tmo6hdi5371.png?width=1287&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a7e70813852641f29b2e57d8fc64ea7f7b83f77)

Notes:

* I am not sure why I called the $480 and $350 price run ups in the visual ""Micro Squeezes"", but thats what came to mind.  Perhaps gamma squeeze is more appropriate given u/yelyah2 recent DD?
* Yellow is micro squeeze 1
* Blue is micro squeeze 2
* Pink is the past 6 days

Alright folks.  I have talked a lot about other peoples work, and given you a graphic.  Now comes my value add.

Key observations:

* Not only was it a 10 trading day ramp up from the February 24th initiation to $350 on March 10th, but it was also **EXACTLY 10 TRADING DAYS** between the January 13th initiation to the $480 peak on January 29th.  My reason for calling this out specifically is that it strengthens the theory surrounding the combined T+35/T+21 day price movements, and helps us further establish that we could potentially go **PARABOLIC AGAIN 10 trading days from 5/25 on JUNE 9th.**  Will they be able to stop us this time?  Maybe it doesn't even matter if the do... See my next points
* In the aftermath of the January ""micro squeeze"" the Dec-Jan price floor of \~$20 **DOUBLED**, and the new price floor was set at \~$40 between Feb 5th - 25th.     In the aftermath of the Feb 24th - Mar 10th ""micro squeeze"" the price floor of \~$40 **TRIPLED**, and the new price floor was set at \~$120 between Feb 5-25.  Given that the price floor doubled and then tripled after these two events, **could we be expecting the new price floor of more than 3X $120?** (That would be a price floor of $360+ for those of you who needed help there)
* Edit to previous bullet: someone makes a fair point that ""We can’t assume that since it doubled in January from $20 to $40 and tripled in March from $40 to $120 that therefore the next floor must be more than 3x $120. What if the rule in the sequence is +20->+80->+140? Or what if +20->+80->+20->+80?""  I have included this just to explicitly state that my question **""could we be expecting the new price floor of more than 3X $120?""** by no means is intended to say the price floor WILL triple again.  I feel like this is a good point to say that this is speculation and theorization based on observation and nothing more.
* The MACD line has literally only had significant crossovers (golden cross) 3 times this year.
   * Event 1, Yellow ($480 run)
   * Event 2, Blue ($350 run)
   * Event 3, Pink (May 17th - today)

Additionally, I have plotted trend lines for each of the events.

* Event 1 (Yellow) we saw a 10 day increase of roughly 1,733%
* Event 2 (Blue) we saw a 10 day increase of roughly 770%.
* 770 / 1733 = 44% or a 56% reduction in 10 day price increase, although the price was starting from a floor of $40 instead of $20.
* 44% of 770% would be 338% starting from $120 which would mean a peak price of \~$405 in event 3, **IF** this short pattern continues exactly the same.
* THIS PATTERN WILL NOT CONTINUE EXACTLY THE SAME.
* I am only observing the trend of the current pattern.  The sample size here is literally 2 events, albeit 2 very unlikely ""coincidental"" events.  And I don't believe in coincidence.
* The pattern will break for many reasons, but the main reason is that hedge fund manipulation literally cannot continue forever.
* Once they get margin called its off to the races, and hopefully this event is the straw that quite literally breaks the camels back (Kenny G, you are the camel)

Oh yeah... forgot about this one.  LOOK AT THE VOLUME.  ITS LITERALLY FUCKING INSANE.  MEDIA IS PUSHING AMC, KOSS, ANYTHING OTHER THAN GME AND YET IT HAS RUN UP FROM $132 (April 13th) TO $290 WITHOUT A SINGLE TRADING DAY VOLUME GREATER THAN 21 MILLION.  WE SAW VOLUMES OF MORE THAN 150 MILLION IN JANUARY!

Alright guys.  To summarize.  We could be looking at going parabolic again on June 9th based on the pattern identified by the authors I mentioned above.  The price action and technical signals are bullish as fuck.

163,163,"CLNE goes beyond the 6/18 event - this is great hold at a 50% discount 🚀🌕 You'd have to be blind to have not seen the chatter on here and other subs about $CLNE and the potential 🚀🌕 gamma squeeze event on 6/18. While the event is a realistic possibility and I'm buying more shares constantly to push it forward, the stock is also a great hold too.

The setup has been explained many times, and is basically a liftoff ramp up to an absolute rocket launch at the $13 price level, where 2.5 million shares worth of calls will be exercisable. They two keys are (1) shares must be bought to drive the price up, and low daily volume makes this drive pretty easy and (2) the call wall is firmly situated on June 18th, the target date.

# But, this post isn't about the squeeze opportunity:

If you want to learn about $CLNE, I would recommend reading  the original DD from several weeks ago. There have been a couple of other good ones on here this week too. Here are some basics about the company that doesn't include the cocaine laden rants that most DD's are filled with. I've been chipping away at buying shares for weeks during this $8 strangle hold.

IN short, CLNE takes Methane from waste sources like the dairy industry and landfills, captures it and converts it into (RNG) renewable natural gas, stores it, and then sells it. Their market focus is on selling to heavy transport/trucking and they position their infrastructure accordingly. 

* **Majorly superior to EV for this application for a few reasons.... Namely because it's faster to fill with RNG than to charge (time is money), batteries for EV's are super heavy (weight is money), and maintenance is the same as a standard engine (money is money).**
* CLNE already has huge partnership with the likes of Total, BP, Chevron, LA mass transit, and **Amazon.**
* **Amazon, as a part of their deal with CLNE, has the right to purchase tons of shares at the $13 price level. The price being the same  as the squeeze is coincidence.**
* CLNE has been building their infrastructure out (stations, etc) with this in mind, purposely constructing them near Amazon warehouse/shipping centers. 
* Other common carriers have already started purchasing/converting fleets to RNG
* Recently, California ports have started offering programs/subsidies to trucks that run RNG - part of their efforts to reduce emissions at the ports, improve air quality, and help the environment.
* &#x200B;

Product, infrastructure, sales, partnerships.... What is it missing? Volume. Various shorts have been beating it down for months and some restructuring by Total as well (they still own almost 50 million shares, don't worry). Buy shares, hold shares, rake tendies.

The June gamma play is still in play, and very possible. Tons of posts about it and most of them are on point with their potential. Some hype, some cocaine mixed in, but most good hearted. Cow farts and all else aside, I like the stock and believe it to be a solid hold with a 2x - 3x price potential and an obvious call options run.

&#x200B;

^(I am a 895 share holder before today, bought 105 more to even out 1,000. I will hold through the year at a minimum, probably longer.)

173,173,"Another Blackberry Love Story. Sweatpants guy. It's true what they say - you never forget your first. 

It's 2007 and I'm working at Future Shop as a retail sales associate in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada up by Conestoga Mall. I've been assigned to sell in the home theater department alongside some veteran TV-pushers and I'm in wayyyy over my head. I'm trying to learn about things like HDMI gold plating and 720p vs 1080p...or was it 1080i? Shit. I dunno. Read the tiny sticker at the bottom and act like you know some stuff. Gesture at the screen and crank that volume on the audio until their ears bleed. That's the ticket.

I'm doing my very best just to keep up but it's obvious that I'm just maybe a little too nice to be in sales. I won't sell hundreds of dollars of add-ons that a family man doesn't really need. I'm not going to push the product service plan (PSP...that word still makes me shudder) if I know that it's pretty much useless. My manager, an Indian dude with a silver tongue and an impeccable sales record, is being kind but really...he's regretting putting me in the highest commission department so soon. 

But then in walks sweatpants-guy. 

He looks pretty much like every other dude that cruises the aisles and asks a tonne of questions that lead nowhere. He's got an old stained shirt and some grey stretched-out sweatpants on. I have zero reason to give this guy the time of day. Nobody else bothers. My slick sales colleagues look through him and past him.

But I grew up poor. I know clothes don't make the man. So I strike up a conversation. Why? Because let's be honest, my sales are non-existent today and I need to have a chat with a real goddamn human being without awkwardly trying to steer the conversation towards buying some techno trash he doesn't really need. 

I talk to sweatpants guy for like 20 minutes. About anything and everything that isn't TVs. About my aspirations to become an airline pilot, how tough an industry it is and how broke I am. About living with my parents again.

My colleagues walk by shaking their heads. Waste. Of. Time.

Then we both realize the time and sweatpants guy tells me why he's really here. He's the a tech director for Research in Motion and he needs ""...just like twenty really good TVs for a few boardrooms...like bigger ones"". 

I try to contain my excitement and point him towards a Samsung 48in or something like that. I give him the speech, on some level subconsciously apologizing for being so awkward. He sizes it up and says ""Huh. Okay looks good. I'll go for it.'

It's all I can do not to cry. 

I ring in the sale and for the first time in a very long time, I start to feel the slightest bit like my life is starting to turn around. 

The next month when I get my paycheck, I walk over to Rogers mobile and put all my cash down on a BB Curve 8320. And mannn is it sexy. Buttons that click juuuust right. Remember those? Mmm yep. Track ball?? Wtf is this magic?? I was in love. 

Oh. And a few weeks later, I quit my job at Future Shop (because let's face it, I was terrible) and  started my new chapter as a BB factory worker. The rest you guys already know from my last post.

That guy was just one of many BB managers who exemplified why I loved that company. A down to earth guy in sweatpants wielding crazy amounts of money, and choosing to back the little guy. 

Still gets me choked up a bit. 

Still holding BB on a Friday morning. 

Cheers buds.

TLDR; BB manager gives broke shitty salesman a shot

**Again guys. Still getting some PMs here about me not being a legit BB stockholder. Same dude. Still a BB holder. Only got two stocks in my Wealthsimple and I ain't f*in selling. Proof:

#Hello shitheads and aspiring shitheads.  It is time to get into cow farts.  *(If you aren’t already. 😉)*


I needed a new play to continue this meme high, and one stood out above the rest, mostly because it has something that gets me all hot and bothered but may frighten and baffle my fellow primates:  

A goddamn date.  *(I know, you’re not used to getting them.)*   
**>>>>June 18th<<<<**


There’s also shit involved, which is just a bonus.


#THE SHIT  
Clean Energy Fuels ($CLNE) specializes in renewable natural gas. Like all good RNG, renewable natural gas is about taking a bunch of random (and literal) bullshit and turning it into beautiful loot.  
In this case, they are grinding for methane. From all the 🐄💨. It’s poot loot.


This is the most natural (ha!) step for the juggernaut initiative that is Green Energy which is coming nation-wide circa 2030 one way or another, even if the rest of the industry is still trying to work out an actual plan.  CLNE is ahead of the game. While 🍦🕶🇺🇸 and co. are trying to decide how much of the country can actually run on all-electric, CLNE is securing deals with a little company called AMZN and securing some huge long term revenue.


#THE (GAMMA) SQUEEZE  
I can’t believe you made it all the way through that last section on only five emoji.  Good boy! Here’s some treats before I go on.  🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌


So what is special about this stock and why the date?  
Well, some rubes went and built a Goldberg machine out of options expiring on 6/18.  If this thing goes off, there will be so much gamma squeezed out that your new green dildo will make Bruce Banner feel inadequate.
  

CLNE has a float of 145 million and had been sitting, flatter than your wife’s boyfriend’s abs, at around $8 for the past month, consolidating and getting all pent up like you when the missus goes on her weeklong trips “to the grocery store”.  
Prior to yesterday’s open, it had an open interest of 47,000 in 6/18 calls with strikes between $9 and $15.  
As of typing, that range now has 69,000 OI (nice!), 65,000 OTM, which means the squeeze potential has only increased with yesterday’s activity.
The most striking (HA!) of these numbers is the 29,000 calls aimed at a share price of $13.


Sure seems like someone knows or is planning something I don’t know about...  Either way, it is set to go off, like you when the missus...


Even before hitting that lucky number 13, calls representing 26 million shares, **18%** of the float and **500%** of the 10-day average volume prior to yesterday, should be hedged.  When it hits $13, 29 million more shares in calls become ITM and the volume beast will begin shitting out green dildos that it will consume to shit more in a shit ouroboros that will fuel the ape shit ship back to the moon.  💩🚀💩🚀💩🚀💩🚀💩🚀  
Yesterday was just a preview of what will happen as more of those strikes are reached. The daily volume exceeded **600%** of the previous 10-day average and that resulted of a share price high of $9.74, **19%** higher than previous close. 

#THE PLAY  
Okay, fair warning, this part pains me to write a bit because it almost doesn’t seem like a bet, but the most safe method, and what will fuel the squeeze, is to buy and HODL shares.  You should know the drill by now. 


The reason shares won’t quite scratch the gambling itch is because CLNE’s ATH of $19 happened just back in February, and it hasn’t dipped far below its current level in five months. [It also has a price target of somewhere between $17 to $18, depending on the analyst.  ](https://finance.yahoo.com/research/stock-forecast/CLNE?symbols=CLNE&ncid=qsprelated_bl1fruji100)  
This means that even with its recent rise, there is not much downside, and the upside is huge even if the gamma squeeze does not play out.  The feeling of holding is not quite the same when there is no apparent risk of your bags being -50% for a quarter of a year before you can break even, I know, but hopefully you can find a way to adjust to all the green in your portfolio.


Shares also benefit from a possible raincheck of the scheduled event should 6/18 fail to deliver.  
While not quite as ideal, 9/17 calls have a whopping 20,881 open interest at the $20 strike which could grow into a similar situation should lower strike interest grow.  There is currently an OI of about 29,000 in the run up range from $10-$19 but it is not so nice and evenly distributed as it is on our magic date.  Worth watching though.

Overall, shares should securely keep your tits below you, if that is how you like them.


Options are where the biggest upside is going to be, and boy is there a lot of potential.  Thanks to CLNE’s month long power nap, premiums ~~are~~ were stupidly low for calls 6/18 strikes $13 and above.  A light breeze is all it took to make some of those ten baggers yesterday.  They still have plenty of room to run and premiums are still somewhat modest, all things considered.  Triggering the squeeze would send these to high heaven.

#TL;DR
Gamma squeeze. CLNE. 6/18.

Back when I was a shithead college kid looking for my first job, I met the CEO of Clean Energy Fuels. I was an Oil/Gas Major and looking to crack in the industry. Mr. Littlefair, the CEO, was an all-time cool guy. After our conversation, he introduced me to their CFO at the time, Rick Wheeler, and said ""Rick, this kid is smitten to get into the industry."" It was so smooth.

They offered me a job on the spot, and it was the best working experience I have had to date. I couldn't imagine if I would have been in the IR department the last two days watching this stock bubble up on WSB. I moved 99.98% of my Robinhood portfolio to CLNE this morning.

Let's get it you apes. This company is nowhere near the size of the typical meme targets and has a decent short interest. We can really make this go to the moon.

If anyone has any questions about Clean Energy, the company, the management team, etc. Please AMA. Because I worked under the Head of IR, I sat on the C-Suite floor with the Chairman, CEO, CFO, COO, Head of Strategy and BD, and Chief of Counsel. I sat in on the earnings calls with analysts, prepared their 10k's, etc,

I LOVE CLNE!!! So do past presidents!

And love you Mr. Littelfair, I will always be indebted for you giving me my first shot ! He has the biggest balls of any CEO  I have ever met.

Yesterday was the shorts warning signal. Today is holding up nicely well above where we started. This is clearly the next $GME/$AMC. With such a small marketcap this should easily 10x when brought up to their valuations. $100-$150 ez clap. It's starting to get attention on Benzinga and Bloomberg. The only reason for today's down move was the ratings downgrade but let's be real if the move was done this would have been back under 10 already. Today's move is only removing the weak hands of yesterday who don't know any better.

YO if you haven't looked at this stock yet, its time to open your eyes. CRSR investors have been watching this roll out for the last 6 months while getting strangle-boned by some big bears.

I wrote a pretty detailed DD on Corsair yesterday and the institutional investor shenanigans that have been going on with it [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nrldny/crsr\_about\_to\_break\_through\_its\_3\_month\_sideways/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nrldny/crsr_about_to_break_through_its_3_month_sideways/)

TL;DR, Corsair is probably one of the most undervalued and manipulated high growth stocks on the market right now. Yea yea many apes say this about a stock...but this one is clear as day with even a cursory look at the history, fundamentals and trading patterns.  It's being held down by short sellers and swing traders profiting off of the extremely low float/low volume.

It has incredible fundamentals in an exploding industry, with rapid growth, increasing profitability, and a massive earnings beat. Nearly the entire tech sector market has outperformed CRSR on technicals, and the price has continued to trade sideways for months, Why?

The only bear case is a bunch of boomers saying computer usage will magically disappear after the pandemic lifts (of course ignoring the fact that 2/3 of the workforce is going partial or full time remote)

It's because they can tank the price with intraday shorts since the volume is so low. And they have been writing millions in call options at $35 and $40 through EOY.

Here's the pattern they're using.... Run stock up to \~$35, increasing options premiums. Write tons of $35C, collect premiums, sell tons of shares (either short or actual), price tanks to $31. They re-purchase / cover shorts at $31... drive options premiums back up... rinse and repeat.

Today, we're seeing something pretty wild happening.

# After Hours Shenanigans

Big money investors have been playing this stock like a puppet. Last night is a prime example. After a week-long run... some big pocket investors managed to instantly tank the price 6% after-hours on very little volume.

https://preview.redd.it/axa93ypdla371.png?width=577&format=png&auto=webp&s=da1039fceba3f44a4dca6b22704629910f45a7b3

These sorts of shenanigans have been par for the course with this stock. After the insta-tank...someone unloaded hundreds of thousands of shares at market open this AM to keep the price down.

Throughout the day, despite big relative trading volume, the price has traded sideways. Why?

What it looks like is aside from big intraday short activity, the big boys are desperate to keep the price under $35. Why? Because they have tens of millions of $ in  $35C and $40C stacked up through the end of year

https://preview.redd.it/pv34llb7ja371.png?width=992&format=png&auto=webp&s=aaf299139407598b777482ab67345abefa0da002

Market forces are TRYING to push this stock up, while whales are doing everything they can to puppet it down.

# Buy Pressure Stalemate

As it stands, buy pressure is nearly double sell side. Drilling down into Level 2, we've seen big buy walls supporting above the $31.5 break even and holding strong.

https://preview.redd.it/6j2k90zhja371.png?width=1883&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1978500195ad12a1e1c8db99914bd23cee8a0b2

The price is sitting on a solid floor in a stalemate.  This stock is literally trading on sale, primed and waiting for some retail momentum to take off.

# The Play

Buying shares and long calls. If this thing takes off and holds past $35 strike by 6/18, its going to moon BIG.

This stock makes huge swings on very little volume. With even a modest uptick in buy volume, its going to make a run. More shares need to change into retail hands.

All of the fundamentals are there. There is absolutley no reason for the current trading pattern other than scratch-deep market manipulation.

182,182,WSB's 11  
183,183,"NOK - Why it's gaining and being discussed. NOK is not a ""Meme"" stock yet, but it could be in the future.

TL;DR NOK is just a great stock with huge growth in it's near future. It's not a short squeeze.

The reason NOK is being discussed so much is because it's rising in price. People are saying there's nothing about NOK that's special, it's been trading flat between $4.00 -$5.00 for the longest time and that 5G is not new. Well, there is a lot of things that are going well for NOK that does need some attention.

NOK is currently undervalued. It's been trading stagnant between $4.00 - $5.00 for quite a while. They're the top leaders in 5G and telecommunications. They also control a large portion of the market share and have acquired more contracts than Ericsson. Ericsson is also another company that is doing well and should see continued growth as NOK but it's currently already trading around its fair value of $13.00. Huawei was a major competitor to both but that is no longer the case. As North America and many other countries across the globe have put sanctions on Huawei and China, tariffs, and claims of espionage, many countries are no longer doing business with Huawei or at least are moving away from them. That brings those clients to companies like NOK and Ericsson.

NOK is not a cell phone maker anymore. They have completely redefined their business model. They're a multinational telecommunications, information technology, and consumer electronics company, and have been for a while. They're projected for massive growth between 2021-2026 and that's from 5G alone. They're already the leader in 6G development and put heavy R&D into it. The business model goes 2021-2026 5G implementation, after that it develops into 6G production. 5G isn't as new as everyone thinks and the majority of the Globe is behind on it's implementation.

Adding that NOK is wanting to do share buy backs, possibility of a dividends being return, and overall growth, the future is looking great for NOK. They also killed their Q1 2021 earnings and are projected to be beating the market by 2023 in growth. People saying that it's history was trading flat also is another benefit as this stock will be a great hedge to inflation. Also, adding once this stock hits it's fair value, there will be more short interest that will develop from the price naturally. At that point, it could very well fall into a ""Meme"" stock category.

But right now, this is not a meme stock. The stock is being talked about and the price going up is not because of WSB, but because investors really want to invest long in NOK because of the company, sector, business, and price.

This stock is actually just a really good stock overall to invest in. It's not a short squeeze, but could develop into one possibly. It has accelerated growth in its future and people just like the stock, it's really that simple. Not all massive gains derive from short squeezes, just saying.

**Edit:** The mods took my original post above down for some reason but didn't advised as to why. I think it's because I didn't highlight how money can be made from it that meets with the standards of WSB, so I added the information below.

NOK is also in negotiations to do a 550M share buy back, which is 10% of the public float which will also increase their EPS.

Proposal of the Board of Directors:

[https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/02/04/proposals-of-the-board-of-directors-to-nokia-corporations-annual-general-meeting-2021/](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/02/04/proposals-of-the-board-of-directors-to-nokia-corporations-annual-general-meeting-2021/)

Apart from NOKIA's expected growth over the next half a decade to a full decade cycle. The options contracts are dirt cheap at the moment. You can buy far out leaps for next to nothing. I hold both shares and options. My predictions, NOK hits $10 minimum EOY.

**Final Edit:** This post was just to clarify why the stock is moving upwards and that it's price is not going up because of WSB or any Short Squeeze Interest.

Michael Burry, the infamous investor who profited massively off the 2008 housing bubble is predicting, like many others, a collapse of the bond market. (Source: Scion Asset Management 13F) [He was even payed a visit by the SEC due to this warning](https://www.businessinsider.in/stock-market/news/big-short-investor-michael-burry-says-hell-stop-tweeting-after-sec-regulators-paid-him-a-visit/articleshow/81569128.cms), prompting him to delete his twitter account.

The FED only has two options at the moment:

Raise rates to curb current inflation. This would cause the treasury to raise its coupon rates (bond interest), which would mean lower bond prices. This means the government has to pay higher interest, ultimately leaving the treasury no other option than defaulting on its obligations.

2. The FED doesnt raise rates, and lets inflation (and later hyperinflation) eat away at the dollar. This would also make the bonds worth less, as theyd have to lower the price to compensate for the interest being worth nothing. In this situation, the fed would be the only one willing to hold government bonds which would worsen the inflation as they effectively dont get payed interest on it.

Option one, the government goes bankrupt due to interests being to high to pay back. Option two, the public goes bankrupt due to hyperinflation.

Either way, a short position would profit in this trade.

AMC has issued almost all of their shares (they've got only 46,124 shares left). And they will NOT issue any additional shares in 2021, according to them. This is good news, as it can certainly help the stock price to move higher.

They issued some shares today, and raised cash. For the company this is a good thing. They are well capitalized now. They asked for permission to issue 25 Million shares sometimes in 2022 - But we can talk about that when it is important, in 2022 their business could be a 110% again, and issuing new shares won't be necessary anymore.

This is the important part of their statement:

""As of today,  in our efforts to best position AMC for a successful recovery from the  pandemic, we have issued or reserved substantially all but 46,124 of the  shares that were previously authorized. ""

I built this heatmap after beating my head against Tableau for a bit (updating the software, resetting passwords, remember how the hell to use it...)

It is a work in progress, as it only has one piece of the data loaded and I filtered out all of the records that the sum of the failure is LESS THAN $50M.  If you are not familiar with a heat map, here's how to understand what you are looking at:  


The darker the blue, the more SHARES are involved.  


The larger the box, the more MONEY is involved.  


Obviously, the really big DOLLAR stuff is tied to index funds... but, have a look at who is BLUEST?  


I'm going outside for a bit, but feel free to ask questions and I'll see what I can do to extend this out to a longer timeline and add filters so you can ""query it""?"
